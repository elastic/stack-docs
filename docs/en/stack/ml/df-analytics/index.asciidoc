{dfanalytics-cap} enable you to perform different analyses of your data and 
annotate it with the results. Essentially, as part of its output, {dfanalytics} 
appends the results of the analysis to the source data. By doing this, it 
provides additional insights into the data. The process leaves the source index 
intact, it creates a new index that contains a copy of the source data and the 
annotated data. You can slice and dice the data extended with the results as you 
normally do with any other data set.

IMPORTANT: Using {dfanalytics} requires source data to be structured as a two 
dimensional "tabular" data structure, in other words a 
{stack-ov}/ml-dataframes.html[{dataframe}]. 
{ref}/data-frame-apis.html[{dataframe-transforms-cap}] allow you to create 
{dataframes} which can be used as the source for {dfanalytics}.
