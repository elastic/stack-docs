Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR - or ELSER - is a retrieval model trained by 
Elastic that enables you to perform 
{ref}/semantic-search-elser.html[semantic search] to retrieve more relevant 
search results. This search type provides you search results based on contextual 
meaning and user intent, rather than exact keyword matches.

ELSER is an out-of-domain model which means it does not require fine-tuning on 
your own data, making it adaptable for various use cases out of the box.

This model is recommended for English language documents and queries. If you 
want to perform semantic search on non-English language documents, use the 
<<ml-nlp-e5>> model.

IMPORTANT: While ELSER V2 is generally available, ELSER V1 is in experimental:[]
and will remain in technical preview.


[discrete]
[[elser-tokens]]
== Tokens - not synonyms

ELSER expands the indexed and searched passages into collections of terms that 
are learned to co-occur frequently within a diverse set of training data. The 
terms that the text is expanded into by the model _are not_ synonyms for the 
search terms; they are learned associations capturing relevance. These expanded 
terms are weighted as some of them are more significant than others. Then the 
{es} {ref}/sparse-vector.html[sparse vector] 
(or {ref}/rank-features.html[rank features]) field type is used to store the 
terms and weights at index time, and to search against later.

This approach provides a more understandable search experience compared to 
vector embeddings. However, attempting to directly interpret the tokens and 
weights can be misleading, as the expansion essentially results in a vector in a 
very high-dimensional space. Consequently, certain tokens, especially those with 
low weight, contain information that is intertwined with other low-weight tokens 
in the representation. In this regard, they function similarly to a dense vector 
representation, making it challenging to separate their individual 
contributions. This complexity can potentially lead to misinterpretations if not 
carefully considered during analysis.


[discrete]
[[elser-req]]
== Requirements

To use ELSER, you must have the {subscriptions}[appropriate subscription] level 
for semantic search or the trial period activated.

NOTE: The minimum dedicated ML node size for deploying and using the ELSER model 
is 4 GB in Elasticsearch Service if 
{cloud}/ec-autoscaling.html[deployment autoscaling] is turned off. Turning on 
autoscaling is recommended because it allows your deployment to dynamically 
adjust resources based on demand. Better performance can be achieved by using 
more allocations or more threads per allocation, which requires bigger ML nodes. 
Autoscaling provides bigger nodes when required. If autoscaling is turned off, 
you must provide suitably sized nodes yourself.


[discrete]
[[elser-v2]]
== ELSER v2

Compared to the initial version of the model, ELSER v2 offers improved retrieval 
accuracy and more efficient indexing. This enhancement is attributed to the 
extension of the training data set, which includes high-quality question and 
answer pairs and the improved FLOPS regularizer which reduces the cost of 
computing the similarity between a query and a document.

ELSER v2 has two versions: one cross-platform version which runs on any hardware 
and one version which is optimized for Intel® silicon. The 
**Model Management** > **Trained Models** page shows you which version of ELSER 
v2 is recommended to deploy based on your cluster's hardware. However, the
recommended way to use ELSER is through the 
{ref}/infer-service-elser.html[{infer} API] as a service which makes it easier
to download and deploy the model and you don't need to select from different 
versions. 

If you want to learn more about the ELSER V2 improvements, refer to 
https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/introducing-elser-v2-part-1[this blog post].


[discrete]
[[upgrade-elser-v2]]
=== Upgrading to ELSER v2

ELSER v2 is not backward compatible. If you indexed your data with ELSER v1, you 
need to reindex it with an ingest pipeline referencing ELSER v2 to be able to 
use v2 for search. This {ref}/semantic-search-elser.html[tutorial] shows you how 
to create an ingest pipeline with an {infer} processor that uses ELSER v2, and 
how to reindex your data through the pipeline.

Additionally, the `elasticearch-labs` GitHub repository contains an interactive 
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/blob/main/notebooks/model-upgrades/upgrading-index-to-use-elser.ipynb[Python notebook] 
that walks through upgrading an index to ELSER V2.


[discrete]
[[download-deploy-elser]]
== Download and deploy ELSER

The easiest and recommended way to download and deploy ELSER is to use the {ref}/inference-apis.html[{infer} API].

1. In {kib}, navigate to the **Dev Console**.
2. Create an {infer} endpoint with the ELSER service by running the following API request:
+
--
[source,console]
----------------------------------
PUT _inference/sparse_embedding/my-elser-model
{
  "service": "elser",
  "service_settings": {
    "num_allocations": 1,
    "num_threads": 1
  }
}
----------------------------------
--
The API request automatically initiates the model download and then deploy the model.

Refer to the {ref}/infer-service-elser.html[ELSER {infer} service documentation] to learn more about the available settings.

After you created the ELSER {infer} endpoint, it's ready to be used for semantic search.
The easiest way to perform semantic search in the {stack} is to {ref}/semantic-search-semantic-text.html[follow the `semantic_text` workflow].

[[alternative-download-deploy]]
=== Alternative methods to download and deploy ELSER

You can also download and deploy ELSER either from **{ml-app}** > **Trained Models**, from **Search** > **Indices**, or by using the trained models API in Dev Console.

[NOTE]
====
* For most cases, the preferred version is the **Intel and Linux optimized**
model, it is recommended to download and deploy that version.
* You can deploy the model multiple times by assigning a unique deployment ID
when starting the deployment. It enables you to have dedicated deployments for
different purposes, such as search and ingest. By doing so, you ensure that the
search speed remains unaffected by ingest workloads, and vice versa. Having
separate deployments for search and ingest mitigates performance issues
resulting from interactions between the two, which can be hard to diagnose.

[[air-gapped-install]]
== Deploy ELSER in an air-gapped environment

If you want to deploy ELSER in a restricted or closed network, you have two 
options:

* create your own HTTP/HTTPS endpoint with the model artifacts on it,
* put the model artifacts into a directory inside the config directory on all 
{ref}/modules-node.html#master-node[master-eligible nodes].


[discrete]
[[elser-model-artifacts]]
=== Model artifact files

For the cross-platform verison, you need the following files in your system:
```
https://ml-models.elastic.co/elser_model_2.metadata.json
https://ml-models.elastic.co/elser_model_2.pt
https://ml-models.elastic.co/elser_model_2.vocab.json
```

For the optimized version, you need the following files in your system:
```
https://ml-models.elastic.co/elser_model_2_linux-x86_64.metadata.json
https://ml-models.elastic.co/elser_model_2_linux-x86_64.pt
https://ml-models.elastic.co/elser_model_2_linux-x86_64.vocab.json
```


[discrete]
=== Using an HTTP server

INFO: If you use an existing HTTP server, note that the model downloader only 
supports passwordless HTTP servers.

You can use any HTTP service to deploy ELSER. This example uses the official 
Nginx Docker image to set a new HTTP download service up.

. Download the <<elser-model-artifacts,model artifact files>>.
. Put the files into a subdirectory of your choice.
. Run the following commands:
+
--
[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
export ELASTIC_ML_MODELS="/path/to/models"
docker run --rm -d -p 8080:80 --name ml-models -v ${ELASTIC_ML_MODELS}:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
--------------------------------------------------

Don't forget to change `/path/to/models` to the path of the subdirectory where 
the model artifact files are located.

These commands start a local Docker image with an Nginx server with the 
subdirectory containing the model files. As the Docker image has to be 
downloaded and built, the first start might take a longer period of time. 
Subsequent runs start quicker.
--
. Verify that Nginx runs properly by visiting the following URL in your 
browser:
+
--
```
http://{IP_ADDRESS_OR_HOSTNAME}:8080/elser_model_2.metadata.json
```

If Nginx runs properly, you see the content of the metdata file of the model.
--
. Point your Elasticsearch deployment to the model artifacts on the HTTP server
by adding the following line to the `config/elasticsearch.yml` file: 
+
--
```
xpack.ml.model_repository: http://{IP_ADDRESS_OR_HOSTNAME}:8080
```

If you use your own HTTP or HTTPS server, change the address accordingly. It is 
important to specificy the protocol ("http://" or "https://"). Ensure that all 
master-eligible nodes can reach the server you specify.
--
. Repeat step 5 on all master-eligible nodes.
. {ref}/restart-cluster.html#restart-cluster-rolling[Restart] the 
master-eligible nodes one by one.
. Navigate to the **Trained Models** page in {kib}, ELSER can be found in the 
list of trained models.
. Click the **Add trained model** button, select the ELSER model version you 
downloaded in step 1 and want to deploy, and click **Download**. The selected 
model will be downloaded from the HTTP/HTTPS server you configured.
. After the download is finished, start the deployment by clicking the 
**Start deployment** button.
. Provide a deployment ID, select the priority, and set the number of 
allocations and threads per allocation values.
. Click **Start**. 

The HTTP server is only required for downloading the model. After the download 
has finished, you can stop and delete the service. You can stop the Docker image 
used in this example by running the following command:

[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
docker stop ml-models
--------------------------------------------------


[discrete]
=== Using file-based access

For a file-based access, follow these steps:

. Download the <<elser-model-artifacts,model artifact files>>. 
. Put the files into a `models` subdirectory inside the `config` directory of 
your Elasticsearch deployment.
. Point your Elasticsearch deployment to the model directory by adding the 
following line to the `config/elasticsearch.yml` file:
+
--
```
xpack.ml.model_repository: file://${path.home}/config/models/`
```
--
. Repeat step 2 and step 3 on all master-eligible nodes.
. {ref}/restart-cluster.html#restart-cluster-rolling[Restart] the 
master-eligible nodes one by one.
. Navigate to the **Trained Models** page in {kib}, ELSER can be found in the 
list of trained models.
. Click the **Add trained model** button, select the ELSER model version you 
downloaded in step 1 and want to deploy and click **Download**. The selected 
model will be downloaded from the model directory where you put in step 2.
. After the download is finished, start the deployment by clicking the 
**Start deployment** button.
. Provide a deployment ID, select the priority, and set the number of 
allocations and threads per allocation values.
. Click **Start**.


[discrete]
== Testing ELSER

You can test the deployed model in {kib}. Navigate to **Model Management** > 
**Trained Models**, locate the deployed ELSER model in the list of trained 
models, then select **Test model** from the Actions menu.

You can use data from an existing index to test the model. Select the index, 
then a field of the index you want to test ELSER on. Provide a search query and 
click **Test**. Evaluating model recall is simpler when using a query related to 
the documents.

The results contain a list of ten random values for the selected field along 
with a score showing how relevant each document is to the query. The higher the 
score, the more relevant the document is. You can reload example documents by 
clicking **Reload examples**.

[[performance]]
== Performance considerations

* ELSER works best on small-to-medium sized fields that contain natural 
language. For connector or web crawler use cases, this aligns best with fields 
like _title_, _description_, _summary_, or _abstract_. As ELSER encodes the 
first 512 tokens of a field, it may not provide as relevant of results for large
fields. For example, `body_content` on web crawler documents, or body fields 
resulting from extracting text from office documents with connectors. For larger
fields like these, consider "chunking" the content into multiple values, where
each chunk can be under 512 tokens.
* Larger documents take longer at ingestion time, and {infer} time per 
document also increases the more fields in a document that need to be processed.
* The more fields your pipeline has to perform inference on, the longer it takes 
per document to ingest.

To learn more about ELSER performance, refer to the <<elser-benchmarks>>.


[discrete]
[[pre-cleaning]]
== Pre-cleaning input text

The quality of the input text significantly affects the quality of the embeddings.
To achieve the best results, it's recommended to clean the input text before generating embeddings.
The exact preprocessing you may need to do heavily depends on your text.
For example, if your text contains HTML tags, use the {ref}/htmlstrip-processor.html[HTML strip processor] in an ingest pipeline to remove unnecessary elements.
Always review and clean your input text before ingestion to eliminate any irrelevant entities that might affect the results.

[[version-overview]]
=== Version overview

ELSER V2 has a **optimized** version that is designed to run only on Linux with 
an x86-64 CPU architecture and a **cross-platform** version that can be run on 
any platform.


[discrete]
[[version-overview-v2]]
==== ELSER V2

Besides the performance improvements, the biggest change in ELSER V2 is the 
introduction of the first platform specific ELSER model - that is, a model 
optimized to run only on Linux with an x86-64 CPU architecture. The optimized 
model is designed to work best on newer Intel CPUs, but it works on AMD CPUs as 
well. It is recommended to use the new optimized Linux-x86-64 model for all new 
users of ELSER as it is significantly faster than the cross-platform model which 
can be run on any platform. ELSER V2 produces significantly higher quality 
embeddings than ELSER V1. Regardless of which ELSER V2 model you use (optimized 
or cross-platform), the particular embeddings produced are the same.


[discrete]
[[elser-qualitative-benchmarks]]
=== Qualitative benchmarks

The metric that is used to evaluate ELSER's ranking ability is the Normalized 
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) which can handle multiple relevant documents 
and fine-grained document ratings. The metric is applied to a fixed-sized list 
of retrieved documents which, in this case, is the top 10 documents (NDCG@10).

The table below shows the performance of ELSER V2 compared to BM 25. ELSER V2 
has 10 wins, 1 draw, 1 loss and an average improvement in NDCG@10 of 18%.

[discrete]
[[elser-hw-benchmarks]]
=== Hardware benchmarks

IMPORTANT: While the goal is to create a model that is as performant as 
possible, retrieval accuracy always take precedence over speed, this is one of 
the design principles of ELSER. Consult with the tables below to learn more 
about the expected model performance. The values refer to operations performed 
on two data sets and different hardware configurations. Your data set has an 
impact on the model performance. Run tests on your own data to have a more 
realistic view on the model performance for your use case.


[discrete]
==== ELSER V2

Overall the optimized V2 model ingested at a max rate of 26 docs/s, compared 
with the ELSER V1 max rate of 14 docs/s from the ELSER V1 benchamrk, resulting 
in a 90% increase in throughput.

The performance of virtual cores (that is, when the number of allocations is 
greater than half of the vCPUs) has increased. Previously, the increase in 
performance between 8 and 16 allocations was around 7%. It has increased to 17% 
(ELSER V1 on 8.11) and 20% (for ELSER V2 optimized). These tests were performed 
on a 16vCPU machine, with all documents containing exactly 256 tokens.

IMPORTANT: The length of the documents in your particular dataset will have a 
significant impact on your throughput numbers.

Refer to 
https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/introducing-elser-v2-part-1[this blog post] 
to learn more about ELSER V2 improved performance.

image::images/ml-nlp-elser-bm-summary.png[alt="Summary of ELSER V1 and V2 benchmark reports",align="center"]

**The optimized model** results show a nearly linear growth up until 8 
allocations, after which performance improvements become smaller. In this case, 
the performance at 8 allocations was 22 docs/s, while the performance of 16 
allocations was 26 docs/s, indicating a 20% performance increase due to virtual 
cores.

image::images/ml-nlp-elser-v2-opt-bm-results.png[alt="ELSER V2 optimized benchmarks",align="center"]

**The cross-platform** model performance of 8 and 16 allocations are 
respectively 14 docs/s and 16 docs/s, indicating a performance improvement due 
to virtual cores of 12%.
