=== Unusual Windows Network Activity

Identifies Windows processes that do not usually use the network but have
unexpected network activity, which can indicate command-and-control, lateral
movement, persistence, or data exfiltration activity. A process with unusual
network activity can denote process exploitation or injection, where the process
is used to run persistence mechanisms that allow a malicious actor remote access
or control of the host, data exfiltration, and execution of unauthorized network
applications.

==== Potential false positives

A newly installed program or one that rarely uses the network could trigger this
signal.

==== Investigation guide

Signals from this rule indicate the presence of network activity from a Windows
process for which network activity is very unusual.  Here are some possible
avenues of investigation:

* Consider the IP addresses, protocol and ports. Are these used by normal but
infrequent network workflows? Are they expected or unexpected?
* If the destination IP address is remote or external, does it associate with
an expected domain, organization or geography? Note: avoid interacting directly
with suspected malicious IP addresses.
* Consider the user as identified by the username field. Is this network
activity part of an expected workflow for the user who ran the program?
* Examine the history of execution. If this process manifested only very
recently, it might be part of a new software package. If it has a consistent
schedule - for example if it runs monthly or quarterly - it might be part of a
monthly or quarterly business process.
* Examine the process arguments, title and working directory. These may provide
indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is
performing.
* Consider the same for the parent process. If the parent process is a
legitimate system utility or service, this could be related to software updates
or system management. If the parent process is something user-facing like an
Office application, this process could be more suspicious.
* If you have file hash values in the event data, and you suspect malware, you
can optionally run a search for the file hash to see if the file is identified
as malware by anti-malware tools.
