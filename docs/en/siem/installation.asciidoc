== Get up and running

beta[]

You need:

* An *Elasticsearch* cluster and *Kibana* (version 6.x or later) with a basic
license. See {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Getting started with the {stack}].
+
[TIP]
==============
You can skip installing {es} and {kib} by using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud. The {es} Service is available on both AWS and GCP.
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup[Try the {es}
Service for free].
==============

* *{beats}* shippers (version 6.x or later) installed on each system you want to
monitor

You might need to modify UI settings in {kib} to change default behaviors,
such as the index pattern used to query the data, and the timestamp field used
for sorting. For more information, see {kib}.

=== Install {beats} shippers

To populate the {siem-ui} with hosts and
network data, you need to install and configure Beats on the endpoints you want to collect and send data:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat[{filebeat}] for forwarding and
centralizing logs and files
* https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/auditbeat[{auditbeat}] for monitoring
directories for file changes
* https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/winlogbeat[{winlogbeat}] for centralizing logs
* https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/packetbeat[{packetbeat}] for analyzing
network packets 

NOTE: {siem-soln} also works with custom and third-party data sources in addition to Beats.
{ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)] makes this possible. Any data tagged as `host.name`
can be used in {siem-soln}. 

You can install {beats} from {kib} or from the command line.

==== Install {beats} from {kib}

Follow the instructions in the Add Data section of the {kib} home page. Click
*Add log data* or *Add metrics*, and follow the links for the types of data you
want to collect.

==== Download and install {beats} from the command line

If your data source isn't in the list, or you want to install {beats} the old
fashioned way:

* *{filebeat} and {filebeat} modules.* See the
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules-quickstart.html[{filebeat} modules quick start]
and enable modules for the events you want to collect. If there is no module
for the events you want to collect, see the
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-getting-started.html[{filebeat} getting started] to
learn how to configure inputs.

* *Auditbeat.* See {auditbeat-ref}/auditbeat-getting-started.html[{auditbeat} getting started]

* *Winlogbeat.* {winlogbeat-ref}/winlogbeat-getting-started.html[{winlogbeat} getting started]

* *Packetbeat.* {packetbeat-ref}/packetbeat-getting-started.html[{packetbeat} getting started]


=== Enable modules and configuration options

For either approach, you need to enable modules in {filebeat} and {metricbeat}
to populate the {SIEM-ui} with data.

To populate the *Hosts* view and add logs, enable (NEEDS UPDATING):

* {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-system.html[{filebeat} `system` module]
* {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules.html[Other {filebeat} modules] needed for
your environment, such as `apache2`, `redis`, and so on
