== SIEM UI

beta[]

After you have your {siem-soln} data sources <<install-siem,up and running>> and
security events are streaming to {es}, check out the {siem-app} in {kib}. You
can view and analyze security events, investigate previous threat detections, or
hunt for new potential security issues.

The {siem-app} is a highly interactive workspace for security analysts. It is
designed to be discoverable, clickable, draggable and droppable, expandable and
collapsible, resizable, moveable, and so forth.

The *{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)]* bar is available
throughout the {siem-app} for searching and filtering.

NOTE: The default index glob patterns defined for {siem-soln} events are 
`endgame-*`, `auditbeat-*`, `winlogbeat-*`, `filebeat-*`, and `packetbeat-*`. 
You can change the default glob patterns in {kib} -> Management -> Advanced 
Settings -> `siem:defaultIndex`.

[[siem-overview-ui]]
=== Overview

The Overview page provides a high-level view into security events available
for analysis, and can help surface problems with data ingestion.

Notice the *Timeline* on the right of the {siem-ui}. It is always available for
starting an investigation, whether in its collapsed or expanded state. Identify
items you want to dig into, and drag and drop them to the Timeline. Those items
are waiting for you when you are ready to start your investigation.

[float]
[[hosts-ui]]
=== Hosts

The Hosts view provides key metrics regarding host-related security
events, and a set of data tables that let you interact with the Timeline Event
Viewer. You can drag and drop items of interest from the Hosts view tables to
Timeline for further investigation.

[role="screenshot"]
image::hosts-ui.png[]

Interactive widgets let you drill down for deeper insights:

* Hosts
* User Authentications (success and failures)
* Unique IPs

There are also tabs for viewing and investigating specific types of data:

* All hosts
* Authentications
* Uncommon processes
* Anomalies
* Events


*Hosts Detail* shows information for a selected host, including
Host ID, First Seen timestamp, Last Seen timestamp, IP and MAC addresses, OS,
versions, machine type, and so forth. Additionally, it contains all the widgets
and tabs relevant for the selected host.

[float]
[[network-ui]]
=== Network

The Network view provides key network activity metrics and an interactive map,
facilitates investigation time enrichment, and provides network event tables that
enable interaction with the Timeline. You can drag and drop items of interest from
the Network view to Timeline for further investigation.

[role="screenshot"]
image::network-ui.png[]

Interactive widgets let you drill down for deeper insights:

* Network events
* DNS queries
* Unique flow IDs
* TLS handshakes
* Unique private IPs

There are also tabs for viewing and investigating specific types of data:

* Flows
** Source IPs
** Destination IPs
** Source Countries
** Destination Countries
* DNS
* TLS
* Anomalies

[float]
[[map-ui]]
=== Map
The map provides a visual overview of your network traffic. It is interactive,
so you can start exploring data directly from the map. Hover over source and
destination points to see more information, such as hostnames and IP addresses.
To drill down, click a point and use the filter icon to add a field to the
filter bar or drag a field to the Timeline. You can also click a hostname
to jump to the SIEM Host page, or an IP address to open the relevant network details.

Just as you can start an investigation using the map, the map refreshes to show
relevant data when you run a query or update the time frame.

TIP: To add and remove layers, click on the more options icon in the top right
corner of the map.

<<conf-map-ui>> describes how to add map data and set up interactions.

[float]
[[timelines-ui]]
=== Timelines

Use timelines as your workspace for alert investigations or threat hunting.
Data from multiple indices can be added to a timeline, which enables
investigating complex threats, such as lateral movement of malware across hosts
in your network.

You can drag objects of interest into the Timeline Event Viewer to create
exactly the query filter you need to get to the bottom of an alert. You can drag
items from table widgets within Hosts and Network pages, or even from within
Timeline itself.

A timeline is responsive and persists as you move through the {siem-app}
collecting data. Auto-saving ensures that the results of your investigation are
available for review by other analysts and incident response teams.


[role="screenshot"]
image::timeline-ui.png[]

Add notes for your own use and to communicate your workflow and findings to
others. You can share a timeline, or pass it off to another person or team. You
can link to timelines from a ticketing system.


[float]
[[raw]]
==== See raw event data

Many security events in Timeline are presented in an easy-to-follow rendered
view, which enables quicker analyst understanding. You can click and expand
events from within Timeline to see the underlying event data, either in tabular
form, as as {es} JSON.

[float]
[[narrow-expand]]
==== Narrow or expand your query

You can specify logical `AND` and `OR` operations with an item's placement in
the drop area. Horizontal filters are `AND`-ed together. Vertical filters or
sets are `OR`-ed together. As you hover the item over the drop area, you can see
whether your placement is on target to create an `AND` or `OR` filters.

[float]
[[pivot]]
==== Pivot on a data point

Click a filter to access additional operations such as exclude, temporarily
disable, or delete items from the query. For example, you can change an included
item so that it is excluded.

[float]
[[row-renderer]]
==== Get more context for each event

As you build and modify your queries, you can see the results of your
interactions in the details pane below.

As your query takes shape, an easy-to-follow rendered view appears for events. It
shows relevant contextual information that helps tell the backstory of the
event. If you see a particular item that interests you, you can drag it to the
drop area for further introspection.

[float]
[[other]]
==== Other actions

The Timeline is flexible and highly interactive.  As you would expect, the
{siem-app} lets you:

* add, remove, reorder, or resize Timeline columns
* save, open, and list Timelines
* add notes to individual events
* add investigation notes for the whole Timeline
* pin events to the Timeline for persistence

Try clicking to expand or collapse items, or dragging and dropping them to other
areas to see what happens. Are there interactions that you would expect to see
that aren't present?  Let us know. We welcome your input.

[[conf-map-ui]]
=== Configuring map data

Depending on your {kib} setup, to display and interact with data on the map you
might need to:

* <<kibana-index-pattern>>
* <<geoip-data, Add geographical IP data to events>>
* <<private-network>>

NOTE: To see source and destination connections lines on the map, you must
configure `source.geo` and `destination.geo` ECS fields for your indices.

[float]
[[kibana-index-pattern]]
==== Create {kib} index patterns

To display map data, you must define
{kib} {kibana-ref}/tutorial-define-index.html[index patterns] (*Management* -> 
*Index Patterns*) with exactly the same names or glob patterns used to define 
the {siem-soln} {es} indices.

NOTE: The {siem-soln} {es} indices are defined in the `siem:defaultIndex` field 
(*{kib}* -> *Management* -> *Advanced Settings* -> *`siem:defaultIndex`*).

For example, if you define a {siem-soln} {es} `servers-europe-*` glob pattern, 
to display map data for the matching indices you must also define a {kib} index 
pattern named `servers-europe-*`. If you use a different {kib} index pattern, 
such as `servers-*`, map data for the indices is *not* displayed.

// =====================
// Keeping this commented out because it will be true in the future...
// To display data on the map, you must define {kib} index patterns 
// (Management -> Index Patterns) that match all the {siem-soln} {es} indices you 
// want to visualize. For more information, see
// {kibana-ref}/tutorial-define-index.html[Define your index patterns].
// =====================

[float]
[[geoip-data]]
==== Add geoIP data

When the ECS {ecs-ref}/ecs-geo.html[source.geo.location and 
destination.geo.location] fields are mapped, network data is displayed on
the map.

If you use Beats, configure a geoIP processor to add data to the relevant 
fields:

[[geo-pipeleine]]
. Define an ingest node pipeline that uses one or more `geoIP` processors to add
location information to events. For example, use the Console in {kib} to create
the following pipeline:
+
--
[source,json]
----
PUT _ingest/pipeline/geoip-info
{
  "description": "Add geoip info",
  "processors": [
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "client.ip",
        "target_field": "client.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "source.ip",
        "target_field": "source.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "destination.ip",
        "target_field": "destination.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "server.ip",
        "target_field": "server.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "host.ip",
        "target_field": "host.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
//CONSOLE
--
+
In this example, the pipeline ID is `geoip-info`. `field` specifies the field
that contains the IP address to use for the geographical lookup, and
`target_field` is the field that will hold the geographical information.
`"ignore_missing": true` configures the pipeline to continue processing when
it encounters an event that doesn't have the specified field.

. In your Beats configuration files, add the pipeline to the 
`output.elasticsearch`tag:
+
[source,yml]
----------------------------------
  output.elasticsearch:
    hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
    pipeline: geoip-info <1>
----------------------------------
<1> The value of this field must be the same as the ingest pipeline name in
<<geo-pipeleine, step 1>> (`geoip-info` in this example).

[float]
[[private-network]]
==== Map your internal network

If you want to add your network’s internal IP addresses to the map, define geo
location fields under the `processors` tag in the Beats configuration files
on your hosts:

[source,yml]
----------------------------------
  processors:
   - add_host_metadata:
   - add_cloud_metadata: ~
   - add_fields:
       when.network.source.ip: <private/IP address> <1>
       fields:
         source.geo.location:
           lat: <latitude coordinate>
           lon: <longitude coordinate>
       target: ''
   - add_fields:
       when.network.destination.ip: <private/IP address>
       fields:
         destination.geo.location:
           lat: <latitude coordinate>
           lon: <longitude coordinate>
       target: ''
----------------------------------
<1> For the IP address, you can use either `private` or CIDR notation.

TIP: You can also enrich your data with other
{packetbeat-ref}/add-host-metadata.html[host fields].
