== Explore the data in {kib}

To get the best results from {ml} analytics, you must understand your data. You
must know its data types and the range and distribution of values. The
{data-viz} enables you to explore the fields in your data: 

. Open {kib} in your web browser. If you are running {kib} locally,
go to `http://localhost:5601/`.

--
TIP: The {kib} {ml-features} use pop-ups. You must configure your
web browser so that it does not block pop-up windows or create an
exception for your {kib} URL.

. Click *Machine Learning* in the side navigation.

. Select the *{data-viz}* tab.

. Click *Select index* and choose the `kibana_sample_data_logs` index pattern.

. Use the time filter to select a time period that you're interested in
exploring. Alternatively, click
*Use full kibana_sample_data_logs data* to view the full time range of data.

. Optional: Change the sample size, which is the number of documents per shard
that are used in the {data-viz}. There is a relatively small number of
documents in the {kib} sample data, so you can choose a value of `all`. For
larger data sets, keep in mind that using a large sample size increases query
run times and increases the load on the cluster.

. Explore the fields in the {data-viz}.

You can filter the list by field names or {ref}/mapping-types.html[field types].
The {data-viz} indicates how many of the documents in the sample for the
selected time period contain each field.

In particular, look at the `clientip`, `response.keyword`, and `url.keyword`
fields, since we'll use them in our {anomaly-jobs}. For these fields, the
{data-viz} provides the number of distinct values, a list of the top values, and
the number and percentage of documents that contain the field. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-gs-data-keyword.jpg["{data-viz} output for ip and keyword fields"]

For numeric fields, the {data-viz} provides information about the minimum,
median, maximum, and top values, the number of distinct values, and their 
distribution. You can use the distribution chart to get a better idea of how the 
values in the data are clustered. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-gs-data-metric.jpg["{data-viz} for sample web logs"]

TIP: Make note of the range of dates in the `@timestamp` field. They are
relative to when you added the sample data and you'll need that information
later in the tutorial.

Now that you're familiar with the data in the `kibana_sample_data_logs` index,
you can create some {anomaly-jobs} to analyze it.
