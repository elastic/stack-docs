:frontmatter-description: An introduction to {ml} {dfanalytics}, which enables you to analyze your data using classification, regression, and outlier detection algorithms and to generate trained models for predictions on new data.

{dfanalytics-cap} enable you to perform different analyses of your data and 
annotate it with the results. By doing this, it provides additional insights 
into the data. <<ml-dfa-finding-outliers,{oldetection-cap}>> identifies unusual 
data points in the data set. <<ml-dfa-regression,{regression-cap}>> makes 
predictions on your data after it determines certain relationships among your 
data points. <<ml-dfa-classification,{classification-cap}>> predicts the class 
or category of a given data point in a data set. {infer-cap} enables you to use 
trained {ml} models against incoming data in a continuous fashion.

The process leaves the source index intact, it creates a new index that contains 
a copy of the source data and the annotated data. You can slice and dice the 
data extended with the results as you normally do with any other data set. Read 
<<ml-dfa-phases>> for more information.

You can evaluate the {dfanalytics} performance by using the {evaluatedf-api} 
against a marked up data set. It helps you understand error distributions and 
identifies the points where the {dfanalytics} model performs well or less 
trustworthily.

Consult <<ml-supervised-workflow>> to learn more about how to make predictions 
with supervised learning.

[[ml-supervised-workflow]]
== Introduction to supervised learning


Elastic supervised learning enables you to train a {ml} model based on training 
examples that you provide. You can then use your model to make predictions on 
new data. This page summarizes the end-to-end workflow for training, evaluating 
and deploying a model. It gives a high-level overview of the steps required to 
identify and implement a solution using supervised learning.

The workflow for supervised learning consists of the following stages:

These are iterative stages, meaning that after evaluating each step, you might 
need to make adjustments before you move further.

[[define-problem]]
=== Define the problem

It’s important to take a moment and think about where {ml} can be most 
impactful. Consider what type of data you have available and what value it 
holds. The better you know the data, the quicker you will be able to create {ml} 
models that generate useful insights. What kinds of patterns do you want to 
discover in your data? What type of value do you want to predict: a category, or 
a numerical value? The answers help you choose the type of analysis that fits 
your use case.

After you identify the problem, consider which of the {ml-features} are most 
likely to help you solve it. Supervised learning requires a data set that 
contains known values that the model can be trained on. Unsupervised learning – 
like {anomaly-detect} or {oldetection} – does not have this requirement.

{stack} provides the following types of supervised learning: 

* {regression}: predicts **continuous, numerical values** like the response time 
  of a web request. 
* {classification}: predicts **discrete, categorical values** like whether a 
  https://www.elastic.co/blog/machine-learning-in-cybersecurity-training-supervised-models-to-detect-dga-activity[DNS request originates from a malicious or benign domain].

[[prepare-transform-data]]
=== Prepare and transform data

You have defined the problem and selected an appropriate type of analysis. The 
next step is to produce a high-quality data set in {es} with a clear 
relationship to your training objectives. If your data is not already in {es}, 
this is the stage where you develop your data pipeline. If you want to learn 
more about how to ingest data into {es}, refer to the 
{ref}/ingest.html[Ingest node documentation].

{regression-cap} and {classification} are supervised {ml} techniques, therefore 
you must supply a labelled data set for training. This is often called the 
"ground truth". The training process uses this information to identify 
relationships among the various characteristics of the data and the predicted 
value. It also plays a critical role in model evaluation.

An important requirement is a data set that is large enough to train a model. 
For example, if you would like to train a {classification} model that decides 
whether an email is a spam or not, you need a labelled data set that contains 
enough data points from each possible category to train the model. What counts 
as "enough" depends on various factors like the complexity of the problem or 
the {ml} solution you have chosen. There is no exact number that fits every 
use case; deciding how much data is acceptable is rather a heuristic process 
that might involve iterative trials.

Before you train the model, consider preprocessing the data. In practice, the 
type of preprocessing depends on the nature of the data set. Preprocessing can 
include, but is not limited to, mitigating redundancy, reducing biases, applying 
standards and/or conventions, data normalization, and so on.

{regression-cap} and {classification} require specifically structured source 
data: a two dimensional tabular data structure. For this reason, you might need 
to {ref}/transforms.html[{transform}] your data to create a {dataframe} which 
can be used as the source for these types of {dfanalytics}.

[[train-test-iterate]]
=== Train, test, iterate

After your data is prepared and transformed into the right format, it is time to 
train the model. Training is an iterative process — every iteration is followed 
by an evaluation to see how the model performs.

The first step is defining the features – the relevant fields in the data set – 
that will be used for training the model. By default, all the fields with 
supported types are included in {regression} and {classification} automatically. 
However, you can optionally exclude irrelevant fields from the process. Doing so 
makes a large data set more manageable, reducing the computing resources and 
time required for training.

Next you must define how to split your data into a training and a test set. The 
test set won’t be used to train the model; it is used to evaluate how the model 
performs. There is no optimal percentage that fits all use cases, it depends on 
the amount of data and the time you have to train. For large data sets, you may 
want to start with a low training percent to complete an end-to-end iteration in 
a short time.

During the training process, the training data is fed through the learning 
algorithm. The model predicts the value and compares it to the ground truth then 
the model is fine-tuned to make the predictions more accurate.

Once the model is trained, you can evaluate how well it predicts previously 
unseen data with the model generalization error. There are further 
evaluation types for both {regression} and {classification} analysis which 
provide metrics about training performance. When you are satisfied with the 
results, you are ready to deploy the model. Otherwise, you may want to adjust 
the training configuration or consider alternative ways to preprocess and 
represent your data.

[discrete]
[[deploy-model]]
=== Deploy model

You have trained the model and are satisfied with the performance. The last step 
is to deploy your trained model and start using it on new data.

The Elastic {ml} feature called {infer} enables you to make predictions for new 
data either by using it as a processor in an ingest pipeline, in a continuous 
{transform} or as an aggregation at search time. When new data comes into your 
ingest pipeline or you run a search on your data with an {infer} aggregation, 
the model is used to infer against the data and make predictions on it.
