{dfanalytics-cap} automatically performs <<ml-feature-encoding>> and transforms 
categorical features to numerical ones. However, it is possible for you to 
define and configure processors that encode the fields you want. Feature 
processors enable you to extract and process features from the raw document 
fields of your index. These features can be used in model training and 
inference. The resulting features are ephemeral; they are not stored in the 
index. This provides a mechanism to create features that can be used at search 
and ingest time and don't take up space in the index. Additionally, it 
simplifies model management as both the features and the model can follow the 
same life cycle.

Automatic categorical encoding still occurs during the analytics process on 
fields with categorical values, even if custom feature processors are used. If 
the user provided feature processor transformed the categorical value of a field 
into numerical one, then automatic feature encoding does not occur on the 
respective field. Refer to the `feature_processors` property of the 
{ref}/put-dfanalytics.html[Create {dfanalytics-job} API] to learn more.

Available feature processors:

* <<frequency-encoding>>
* <<multi-encoding>>
* <<ngram-encoding>>
* <<one-hot-encoding>>
* <<target-mean-encoding>>


[[frequency-encoding]]
== Frequency encoding

Frequency encoding takes into account how many times a given categorical feature 
is present in relation to the value of the encoded field. The more frequently 
the feature is present, the greater the weight of the feature in the data set. 
With this encoding technique, it is not possible to get back to the categorical 
values after the encoding is done as different categories may have the same 
frequency.

_The figure shows a simple frequency encoding example. The Animal_freq value of 
`cat` is 0.5 as the feature is present at half of the number of related values. 
The labels `dog` and `crocodile` occur only once each. For this reason, the 
Animal_freq value of these labels is 0.25._


[[multi-encoding]]
== Multi encoding

Multi encoding enables you to use multiple processors in the same 
{dfanalytics-job}. You can define an ordered sequence of processors in which the 
output of a processor can be forwarded to the next processor as an input. For 
example, you can define an NGram feature processor that creates a series of 
ngrams that can be encoded by a chained one hot encoding processor.


[[ngram-encoding]]
== NGram encoding

NGram encoding encodes a string into a collection of ngrams (a sequence of n 
items) of a configured length. The output of this encoding is categorical. 
Consequently, additional automatic processing will be done to the resulting 
ngrams.

_The table shows the NGram encoding of the Animal field. It executes unigram and 
bigram encoding (ngram of size 1 and 2) and goes to the string length of 3._


[[one-hot-encoding]]
== One hot encoding

One hot encoding transforms categorical values into numerical ones by assigning 
vectors to each category. The vector represents whether the corresponding 
feature is present (1) or not present (0) at the given value, so the encoding 
method maps the different categorical features to the numerical values.

image::images/one-hot-encoding.jpg["One hot encoding"]
_One hot encoding maps each category to the corresponding value. If the 
category is present at a given value, the assigned vector is `1`, if it is not, 
the vector is `0`._


[[target-mean-encoding]]
== Target mean encoding

Target mean encoding replaces categorical values with the mean value of the 
target variable as it relates to the categorical variable itself.

image::images/target-mean-encoding.jpg["Target mean encoding"]
_The figure shows a simple target mean encoding example. The label `cat` has 
two occurrences in the data set. One of them has a corresponding target variable 
of `0`, the other one has a `1`.  The `Animal_target_mean` value of the `cat` 
label is 0.5 after using the target mean encoding processor while the value of 
`dog` and `crocodile` is 1 as each of their occurrences has a corresponding 
target variable of `1`._
