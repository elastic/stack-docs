=== Create forecasts

In addition to detecting anomalous behavior in your data, you can use the
{ml-features} to predict future behavior.

To create a forecast in {kib}:

. Go to the **Single Metric Viewer** and select one of the jobs that you created
in this tutorial. For example, select the `low_request_rate` job. 

. Click **Forecast**. +

. Specify a duration for your forecast. This value indicates how far to
extrapolate beyond the last record that was processed. You must use
{ref}/common-options.html#time-units[time units]. In this example, the duration
is one week (`1w`): +

The yellow line in the chart represents the predicted data values. The shaded
yellow area represents the bounds for the predicted values, which also gives an
indication of the confidence of the predictions. Note that the bounds generally
increase with time (that is to say, the confidence levels decrease), since you
are forecasting further into the future. Eventually if the confidence levels are
too low, the forecast stops.

. Optional: Compare the forecast to actual data. +

As the job processes more data, you can choose to see the forecast overlaid on
the actual data. The chart contains the actual data values, the bounds for the
expected values, the anomalies, the forecast data values, and the bounds for the
forecast. This combination of actual and forecast data gives you an indication
of how well the {ml-features} can extrapolate the future behavior of the data.

To generate this comparison for the {kib} sample data, use only a subset of the
data when you create the job. For example, follow the steps in <<ml-gs-jobs>>
but add a different job ID prefix and deselect the
**Use full kibana_sample_data_logs data** option. Choose a date part way
through your sample data as the end date. By default, the {dfeed} stops and the
{anomaly-job} closes when it reaches that date. Create the forecast. You can
then restart the {dfeed} to process the remaining data and generate the type of
results shown here.

TIP: The {kib} sample data sets have timestamps that are relative to when you
added the data sets. However, some of these dates are in the future. Therefore,
for the purposes of this tutorial, when you restart your {dfeed} do not use the
**No end time (Real-time search)** option. Specify the appropriate end dates so
that it processes all of the data immediately.

Now that you have seen how easy it is to create forecasts with the sample data,
consider what type of events you might want to predict in your own data. For
more information and ideas, as well as a list of limitations related to
forecasts, see <<ml-forecasting>>.
