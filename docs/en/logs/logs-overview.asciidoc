Logs monitoring enables you to view logs from your infrastructure to help identify problems in real-time.
You can view logs from servers, containers, services, and so on.
Additionally, you can drill down to view detailed information about an individual log entry, or you can seamlessly switch to view corresponding metrics, uptime information, or APM traces where available. You can also use machine learning to detect specific log anomalies automatically.

=== Logs monitoring components

Logs monitoring requires the following {stack} components.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[{es}]* is a real-time,
distributed storage, search, and analytics engine.
{es} can store, search, and analyze large volumes of data in near real-time.
The {logs-app} uses {es} to store logs data in {es} documents which are queried on demand.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[{beats}]* are open source data shippers that you install as agents on your servers to send data to {es}.
The {logs-app} uses Filebeat to collect logs from the servers, containers, and other services in your infrastructure.
Filebeat modules are available for most typical servers, containers, and services.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[{kib}]* is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with {es}.
You use {kib} to search, view, and interact with the logs data stored in {es}.
You can perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables,
and maps.
The <<logs-app-overview, {logs-app}>> in {kib} provides a dedicated user interface to view logs from the servers, containers, and services in your infrastructure.
