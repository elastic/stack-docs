== How monitoring works

Monitoring collects data from {es} nodes, Logstash nodes, {kib} instances, and
Beats.

In general, the {es} cluster you are monitoring controls where the monitoring
metrics for the stack are stored. By default, they are stored in local indices.

TIP: In production, we strongly recommend using a separate monitoring cluster.
Using a separate monitoring cluster prevents production cluster outages from
impacting your ability to access your monitoring data. It also prevents
monitoring activities from impacting the performance of your production cluster.
For the same reason, we also recommend using a separate Kibana instance for
viewing the monitoring data.

You can use {metricbeat} to collect and ship data about {es}, {kib}, {ls}, and
Beats directly to your monitoring cluster rather than routing it through your
production cluster. The following diagram illustrates a typical monitoring
architecture with separate production and monitoring clusters:

If you have at least a gold license, you can route data from multiple production
clusters to a single monitoring cluster. For more information about the
differences between various subscription levels, see: https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions

IMPORTANT: In general, the monitoring cluster and the clusters being monitored
should be running the same version of the stack. A monitoring cluster cannot
monitor production clusters running newer versions of the stack. If necessary,
the monitoring cluster can monitor production clusters running the latest
release of the previous major version.
