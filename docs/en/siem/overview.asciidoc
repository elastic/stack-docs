== Overview

IMPORTANT: This document is a work in progress. 
It covers features scheduled for beta release in 7.2.

{siem-soln} gives you a comprehensive view into your security operations,
and helps make those insights actionable.

The {siem-app} in {kib} brings together data from a variety of sources, making it easier
for you to identify and resolve security issues.

[[siem-components]]
=== SIEM components

SIEM requires the following {stack} components.

image::images/siem-architecture.png[]

*https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[{beats}]* are open source data
shippers that you install as agents on your servers to send operational data to
{es}. 

*https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[{es}]* is a real-time,
distributed storage, search, and analytics engine. {es} excels is indexing
streams of semi-structured data, such as logs or metrics.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[{kib}]* is an open source analytics and
visualization platform designed to work with {es}. You use {kib} to search,
view, and interact with data stored in {es} indices. You can easily perform
advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables,
and maps.

The {siem-ui} in {kib} provides a dedicated user interface for visualizing host security.

[[siem-integration]]
==== Elastic integration

{siem-soln} also integrates with other Elastic products and features to help you
identify and report on suspicious activity:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/stack/machine-learning[{ml-cap}] 
* https://www.elastic.co/products/stack/alerting[Alerting]
* https://www.elastic.co/products/stack/canvas[Canvas]

[[data-sources]]
=== Data sources

SIEM can collect and normalize data from a variety of sources, including Beats
and Beats modules, and third-party collectors mapped to the {ecs-ref}[Elastic
Common Schema (ECS)].

[float]
[[ecs]]
==== Elastic Common Schema (ECS) for normalizing data

The {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)] defines a common set of fields to be used for
storing event data in Elasticsearch. ECS helps users normalize their event data
to better analyze, visualize, and correlate the data represented in their
events. 

{siem-soln} can collect and normalize events from ECS-compatible data sources.

[float]
[[host_id]]
===== Host identification
All Beats use the `add_host_metadata` processor to add the `host.name` field to
events. The default value is `host.name`, but you can change it in Beats
processor settings.

Data from custom or third-party sources that is tagged `host.name` can be included.
