=== Upgrade your deployment or cluster

Before you can upgrade your deployment or cluster to {version}, ensure you're <<prepare-upgrade-9.0,prepared to upgrade>>. 

The procedures you follow to upgrade depend whether you've installed Elastic components using Elastic-managed infrastructure or self-managed infrastructure. 

If you're running Elastic-managed infrastructure, your options are: 

* <<upgrade-elastic-stack-for-elastic-cloud,Upgrading on Elastic Cloud Hosted (ECH)>>
* Upgrading on {serverless-full} (updates are automatic and require no user management)

If you're running your own self-managed infrastructure â€“ either on-prem or on public cloud, your options are: 

* <<upgrading-elastic-stack-on-prem,Upgrading the {stack}>> (upgrade each component individually)
* <<upgrade-on-ece,Upgrading on {ece}>> (ECE)
* <<upgrade-on-eck,Upgrading on {eck}>> (ECK)

NOTE: Before you begin upgrading on ECE or ECK, ensure your orchestrator is compatible with {version}.
