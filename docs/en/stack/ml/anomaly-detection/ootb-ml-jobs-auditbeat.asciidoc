These {anomaly-job} wizards appear in {kib} if you use 
{auditbeat-ref}/index.html[{auditbeat}] to audit process activity on your 
systems. For more details, see the {dfeed} and job definitions in the
`auditbeat_*` folders in
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/{branch}/x-pack/plugins/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules[GitHub].

docker_high_count_process_events_ecs::

* For Auditbeat data where `event.module` is `auditd` and `container.runtime` is 
`docker`.
* Models process execution rates (`partition_field_name` is `container.name`).
* Detects unusual increases in process execution rates in Docker containers 
  (using the <<ml-count,`high_count` function>>).

docker_rare_process_activity_ecs::

* For Auditbeat data where `event.module` is `auditd` and `container.runtime` is 
`docker`.
* Models occurrences of process execution (`partition_field_name` is 
  `container.name`).
* Detects rare process executions in Docker containers (using the 
  <<ml-rare,`rare` function>>).

hosts_high_count_process_events_ecs::

* For Auditbeat data where `event.module` is `auditd`.
* Models process execution rates (`partition_field_name` is `host.name`).
* Detects unusual increases in process execution rates (using the 
  <<ml-nonzero-count,`high_non_zero_count` function>>).

hosts_rare_process_activity_ecs::

* For Auditbeat data where `event.module` is `auditd`.
* Models process execution rates (`partition_field_name` is `host.name`).
* Detects rare process executions on hosts (using the 
  <<ml-rare,`rare` function>>).
