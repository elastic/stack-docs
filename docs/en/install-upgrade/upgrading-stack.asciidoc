== Upgrading the Elastic Stack

When upgrading to a new version of {es}, you need to upgrade
each of the products in your Elastic Stack. Beats and Logstash 7.n are
compatible with {es} {version} to give you flexibility in scheduling
the upgrade.

{es} supports rolling upgrades between minor versions, from {es} 5.6 to 6.8,
from 6.8 to 7.x, and from 7.n to {version}.

IMPORTANT: 6.x and older indices are not compatible with {version}. You must
remove or reindex them on your 7.x cluster before upgrading to {version}. The internal
Kibana and {xpack} indices and the default Beats and Logstash mapping templates
also need to be updated to work with {version}.

Refer to the upgrade instructions for your environment:
