== Overview

{siem-soln} enables analysis of host-related and network-related security events
as part of alert investigations or interactive threat hunting.

The {siem-app} in {kib} provides an interactive workspace for security teams to
triage events and perform initial investigations. Additionally,
<<machine-learning, {ml} {anomaly-jobs}>> and
<<detection-engine-overview, detection engine rules>> provide ways to 
automatically detect suspicious activity across your entire fleet of servers 
and workstations.

[[siem-components]]
=== SIEM components

SIEM requires the following {stack} components.

image::images/siem-architecture.png[]

*https://www.elastic.co/products/endpoint-security[Elastic Endpoint Security]*
is an endpoint security platform and agent that provides prevention, detection,
and response capabilities. It ships events and security alerts directly to {es}. 

*https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[{beats}]* are open source data shippers
that you install as agents on your systems. {beats} send security events and other
data to {es}. 

*https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[{es}]* is a real-time,
distributed storage, search, and analytics engine. {es} excels at indexing
streams of semi-structured data, such as logs or metrics.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[{kib}]* is an open source analytics and
visualization platform designed to work with {es}. You use {kib} to search,
view, and interact with data stored in {es} indices. You can easily perform
advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables,
and maps.

The {siem-app} in {kib} provides a dedicated user interface for analyzing and
investigating host and network security events.

[[siem-integration]]
==== Additional Elastic components

You can use {siem-soln} with other Elastic products and features to help you
identify and investigate suspicious activity:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/stack/machine-learning[{ml-cap}] 
* https://www.elastic.co/products/stack/alerting[Alerting]
* https://www.elastic.co/products/stack/canvas[Canvas]

[float]
[[data-sources]]
=== Data sources

SIEM can ingest and analyze data from a variety of sources, including Elastic
Endpoint Security, Beats and Beats modules, 
{apm-app-ref}/transactions.html[APM transactions], and third-party 
collectors mapped to the {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]. 

[float]
[[hosts-data-sources]]
==== Hosts data sources

* https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/auditbeat[{auditbeat}]
** {auditbeat-ref}/auditbeat-module-system.html[System module  - Linux, macOS, Win]
*** packages
*** processes
*** logins
*** sockets

==== Network data sources

[float]
[[endpoint-security-platform]]
==== Elastic Endpoint Sensor Management Platform

The Sensor Management Platform (SMP) ships all relevant host and network data
directly to the {siem-app}.

[float]
[[apm-transactions-data]]
==== APM transactions

By default, the {siem-app} monitors {apm-app-ref}/apm-getting-started.html[APM] 
`apm-*-transaction*` indices. To add additional APM indices, update the 
index patterns in the `siem:defaultIndex` setting ({kib} -> Management -> 
Advanced Settings -> `siem:defaultIndex`).

[float]
[[ecs]]
==== Elastic Common Schema (ECS) for normalizing data

The {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)] defines a common set of fields to be used for
storing event data in Elasticsearch. ECS helps users normalize their event data
to better analyze, visualize, and correlate the data represented in their
events. 

{siem-soln} can ingest and normalize events from ECS-compatible data sources.

[float]
[[host_id]]
===== Host identification
All Beats use the `add_host_metadata` processor to add the `host.name` field to
events. The default value is `host.name`, but you can change it in Beats
processor settings.
