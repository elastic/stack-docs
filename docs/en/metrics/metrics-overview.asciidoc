=== Metrics monitoring components

Metrics monitoring requires the following {stack} components.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[{es}]* is a real-time,
distributed storage, search, and analytics engine. {es} can store, search, and analyze large volumes of data in near real-time.
The {metrics-app} uses {es} to store metrics data in {es} documents which are queried on demand.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[{beats}]* are open source data shippers that you install as agents on your servers to send data to {es}.
The {metrics-app} uses Metricbeat to collect metrics from the servers, containers, and other services in your infrastructure.
Metricbeat modules are available for most typical servers, containers, and services.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[{kib}]* is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with {es}.
You use {kib} to search, view, and interact with the metrics data stored in {es}.
You can perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables,
and maps.
The {metrics-app} in {kib} provides a dedicated user interface to view metrics for your infrastructure.
