== Create sample {ml} jobs in {kib}

Now that we have taken a quick look at the type of data that is stored in the 
`kibana_sample_data_logs` index, let's create some {ml} jobs to start analyzing
the data.

The {kib} sample data sets include some pre-configured {ml} jobs for you to play
with. You can use either of the following methods to add the jobs:

* After you load the sample web logs data set on the {kib} home page, click
*View data* > *ML jobs*.
* In the Machine Learning app, when you select the `kibana_sample_data_logs`
index pattern in the *Data Visualizer* or the *Anomaly Detection* job wizards,
it recommends that you create a job using its known configuration. Select the
*Kibana sample data web logs* configuration.

The wizard recommends three jobs: `low_request_rate`, `response_code_rates`, and
`url_scanning`. You can tell by the job descriptions that even though these jobs
use the same data, they are seeking three different types of anomalous behavior.

//For the purposes of this tutorial, we do not want to start the {dfeed} or use
//the full data set immediately. Click the check boxes to deselect these options.

Click *Create Jobs*. When all three jobs and {dfeeds} have been created and
started, you receive a summary:

{dfeeds-cap} retrieve data from {es} indices for analysis by {anomaly-job} jobs.
For more information about these concepts, see <<ml-jobs>> and <<ml-dfeeds>>.

//TO-DO: Take a closer look at one of these jobs to clarify what its purpose is.

The next step is to view the results and see what types of insights these {ml}
jobs have generated!

This tutorial uses {kib} to create jobs and view results, but you can
alternatively use APIs to accomplish most tasks.
For API reference information, see {ref}/ml-apis.html[Machine learning APIs].
