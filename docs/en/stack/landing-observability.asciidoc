never looked so good.

== What is Observability?

{obsrv} allows you to detect undesirable behaviors in your systems, like
service downtime, errors, slow responses, then view actionable information--
detailed event logs, granular resource usage information, and application traces
-- to pin down root cause as quickly as possible.
