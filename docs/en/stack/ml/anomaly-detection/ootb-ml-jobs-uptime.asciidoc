If you have appropriate {heartbeat} data in {es}, you can enable this
{anomaly-job} in the 
{observability-guide}/monitor-uptime.html[{uptime-app}] in {kib}. For more 
details, see the {dfeed} and job definitions in 
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/{branch}/x-pack/plugins/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/uptime_heartbeat/ml[GitHub].

This configuration is only available if data exists that matches the following 
term query: `"agent.type": "heartbeat"`.


high_latency_by_geo::

* Detects unusually high average latency values (using the
<<ml-metric-mean,`high_mean` function>> on the `monitor.duration.us` field).
* Models the occurrences across geographical locations (`partition_field_name` 
  is `observer.geo.name`).
