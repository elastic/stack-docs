*Symptoms*:
There is no information about your cluster on the *Monitoring* page in {kib}.

*Resolution*:
Check whether the appropriate indices exist on the monitoring cluster. For
example, use the {ref}/cat-indices.html[cat indices] command to verify that
there is a `.monitoring-kibana*` index for your {kib} monitoring data and a
`.monitoring-es*` index for your {es} monitoring data. If you are collecting
monitoring data by using {metricbeat} the indices have `-mb` in their names. If
the indices do not exist, review your configuration: <<xpack-monitoring>>.
