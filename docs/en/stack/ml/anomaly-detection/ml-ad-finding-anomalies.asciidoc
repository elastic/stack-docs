:frontmatter-description: An introduction to {ml} {anomaly-detect}, which analyzes time series data to identify and predict anomalous patterns in your data.

:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [analyze]

The {ml} {anomaly-detect} features automate the analysis of time series data by
creating accurate baselines of normal behavior in your data. These baselines
then enable you to identify anomalous events or patterns. Data is pulled from
{es} for analysis and anomaly results are displayed in {kib} dashboards. For
example, the *{ml-app}* app provides charts that illustrate the actual data
values, the bounds for the expected values, and the anomalies that occur outside
these bounds:
