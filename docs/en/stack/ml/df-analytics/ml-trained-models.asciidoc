[[ml-trained-models]]
= Trained models
:keywords: {ml-init}, {stack}, {dfanalytics}

When you use a {dfanalytics-job} to perform {classification} or {reganalysis},
it creates a {ml} model that is trained and tested against a labelled data set.
When you are satisfied with your trained model, you can use it to make
predictions against new data. For example, you can use it in the processor of
an ingest pipeline or in a pipeline aggregation within a search query. For more
information about this process, see <<ml-supervised-workflow>> and
<<ml-inference-class,{infer} for {classification}>> and 
<<ml-inference-reg,{regression}>>.

You can also supply trained models that are not created by {dfanalytics-job} but
adhere to the appropriate
https://github.com/elastic/ml-json-schemas[JSON schema]. If you want to use
these trained models in the {stack}, you must store them in {es} documents by
using the {ref}/put-trained-models.html[create trained models API].

In {kib}, you can view and manage your trained models within *{ml-app}* > *Data
Frame Analytics*:

image::images/trained-model-management.png["List of trained models in the {ml-app} app in {kib}"]

Alternatively, you can use APIs like
{ref}/get-trained-models.html[get trained models] and
{ref}/delete-trained-models.html[delete trained models].

[[export-import]]
== Exporting and importing models

Models trained in Elasticsearch are portable and can be transferred between
clusters. This is particularly useful when models are trained in isolation from
the cluster where they are used for inference. The following instructions show
how to use https://curl.se/[`curl`] and https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`jq`] to
export a model as JSON and import it to another cluster.

1. Given a model _name_, find the model _ID_. You can use `curl` to call the
{ref}/get-trained-models.html[get trained model API] to list all models with
their IDs.
+
--
[source, bash]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -s -u username:password \
  -X GET "http://localhost:9200/_ml/trained_models" \
    | jq . -C \
    | more
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

If you want to show just the model IDs available, use `jq` to select a subset.

[source, bash]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -s -u username:password \
  -X GET "http://localhost:9200/_ml/trained_models" \
    | jq -C -r '.trained_model_configs[].model_id'
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

[source, bash]
--------------------------------------------------
flights1-1607953694065
flights0-1607953585123
lang_ident_model_1
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

In this example, you are exporting the model with ID `flights1-1607953694065`.
--

2. Using `curl` from the command line, again use the
{ref}/get-trained-models.html[get trained models API] to export the entire model
definition and save it to a JSON file.
+
--
[source, bash]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -u username:password \
  -X GET "http://localhost:9200/_ml/trained_models/flights1-1607953694065?exclude_generated=true&include=definition&decompress_definition=false" \
    | jq '.trained_model_configs[0] | del(.model_id)' \
    > flights1.json
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

A few observations:

* Exporting models requires using `curl` or a similar tool that can *stream*
the model over HTTP into a file. If you use the {kib} Console, the
browser might be unresponsive due to the size of exported models.

* Note the query parameters that are used during export. These parameters are necessary to
export the model in a way that it can later be imported again and used for
inference.

* You must unnest the JSON object by one level to extract just the model
definition. You must also remove the existing model ID in order to not have
ID collisions when you import again. You can do these steps using `jq` inline or
alternatively it can be done to the resulting JSON file after downloading using
`jq` or other tools.
--

3. Import the saved model using `curl` to upload the JSON file to the
{ref}/put-trained-models.html[created trained model API]. When you specify the URL,
you can also set the model ID to something new using the last path part of the
URL.
+
--
[source, bash]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -u username:password \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/_ml/trained_models/flights1-imported" \
  --data-binary @flights1.json
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
--

[NOTE]
--
* Models exported from the {ref}/get-trained-models.html[get trained models API]
are limited in size by the
{ref}/modules-network.html[http.max_content_length]
global configuration value in {es}. The default value is `100mb` and may need to 
be increased depending on the size of model being exported.

* Connection timeouts can occur, for example, when model sizes are very large or 
your cluster is under load. If needed, you can increase
https://ec.haxx.se/usingcurl/usingcurl-timeouts[timeout configurations] for
`curl` (for example, `curl --max-time 600`) or your client of choice.
--

If you also want to copy the {dfanalytics-job} to the new cluster, you can 
export and import jobs in the *{stack-manage-app}* app in {kib}. Refer to
<<move-jobs>>.

[[import-external-model-to-es]]
== Importing an external model to the {stack}

It is possible to import a model to your {es} cluster even if the model is not
trained by Elastic {dfanalytics}. Eland supports
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/eland/current/machine-learning.html[importing models]
directly through its APIs. Please refer to the latest
https://eland.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[Eland documentation] for more 
information on supported model types and other details of using Eland to import 
models with.
