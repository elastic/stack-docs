[[requirements-overview]]
== Requirements overview

To use the {stack} {ml-features}, you must have:

[%interactive]
- [ ] the {subscriptions}[appropriate subscription] level or the free trial 
  period activated
- [ ] `xpack.ml.enabled` set to its default value of `true` on every node in the 
  cluster (refer to {ref}/ml-settings.html[{ml-cap} settings in {es}])
- [ ] `ml` value defined in the list of `node.roles` on the 
  {ref}/modules-node.html#ml-node[{ml} nodes]
- [ ] {ml} features visible in the {kib} space
- [ ] security privileges assigned to the user that:
    * grant use of {ml-features}, and
    * grant access to source and destination indices.

TIP: The fastest way to get started with {ml-features} is to
{ess-trial}[start a free 14-day trial of {ess}] in the cloud.

[[setup-privileges]]
== Security privileges for {es} and {kib}

Assigning security privileges affects how users access {ml-features}. Consider 
the two main categories:

* *<<es-security-privileges>>*: uses an {es} client, cURL, or {kib} Dev Tools to 
  access {ml-features} via {es} APIs. It requires {es} security privileges.
* *<<kib-security-privileges>>*: uses the {ml-features} in {kib} and does not 
use Dev Tools. It requires either {kib} feature privileges or {es} security 
privileges and is granted the most permissive combination of both. {kib} feature 
privileges are recommended if you control job level visibility via _Spaces_. 
{ml-cap} features must be visible in the relevant space. Refer to 
<<kib-visibility-spaces>> for configuration information.

You can configure these privileges under **{stack-manage-app}** > _Security_ in 
{kib} or via the respective {es} security APIs.

[[es-security-privileges]]
=== {es} API user

If you use {ml} APIs, you must have the following cluster and index privileges:

For full access:

[%interactive]
* [ ] `machine_learning_admin` built-in role or the equivalent cluster 
privileges 
* [ ] `read` and `view_index_metadata` on source indices
* [ ] `read`, `manage`, and `index` on destination indices (for 
  {dfanalytics-jobs} only)

For read-only access:

[%interactive]
* [ ] `machine_learning_user` built-in role or the equivalent cluster privileges
* [ ] `read` index privileges on source indices
* [ ] `read` index privileges on destination indices (for {dfanalytics-jobs}
  only)


[discrete]
[[kib-visibility-spaces]]
=== {kib} feature visibility in Spaces

In {kib}, the {ml-features} must be visible in your
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-feature-visibility[space]. To 
control which features are visible in your space, use **{stack-manage-app}** > 
_{kib}_ > _Spaces_.

In addition to index privileges, source {data-sources} must also exist in the 
same space as your {ml} jobs. These can be configured in **{stack-manage-app}** 
> _{kib}_ > _{data-sources-caps}_.


Each {ml} job can be assigned to all, one or multiple spaces. This can be 
configured in **{stack-manage-app}** > _Alerts and Insights_ > 
_Machine Learning Jobs_. To assign a job to a space, select the spaces icon 
shown in the job list.

[[kib-security-privileges]]
=== {kib} user

Within a {kib} space, for full access to the {ml-features}, you must have:

[%interactive]
* [ ] `Machine Learning: All` {kib} privileges
* [ ] `{data-sources-caps} Management: All` {kib} feature privileges
* [ ] `read`, and `view_index_metadata` index privileges on your source indices
* [ ] {data-sources} for your source indices
* [ ] {data-sources}, `read`, `manage`, and `index` index privileges on 
  destination indices (for {dfanalytics-jobs} only)


Within a {kib} space, for read-only access to the {ml-features}, you must have:

[%interactive]
* [ ] `Machine Learning: Read` {kib} privileges
* [ ] {data-sources} for your source indices
* [ ] `read` index privilege on your source indices
* [ ] {data-sources} and `read` index privileges on destination indices (for 
  {dfanalytics-jobs} only)

NOTE: {data-sources-cap} can be automatically created when creating a 
{dfanalytics-job}.

For access to use {ml} APIs via _Dev Tools_ in {kib}, set the {es} security 
privileges and grant access to `machine_learning_admin` or 
`machine_learning_user` built-in roles.

[[upload-file-security-privileges]]
== Security privileges for {data-viz}

Within a {kib} space, to upload and import files in the *{data-viz}*, you must 
have:

[%interactive]
- [ ] `Machine Learning: All` or `Machine Learning: Read` or `Discover: All` 
  {kib} feature privileges
- [ ] `{data-sources-caps} Management: All` {kib} feature privileges
- [ ] `ingest_admin` built-in role, or `manage_ingest_pipelines` cluster 
  privilege
- [ ] `create`, `create_index`, `manage` and `read` index privileges for
  destination indices

and {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[{kib} privileges].
