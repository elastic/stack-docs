== Configuring external connections

You can push new cases and case updates to {sn}. To do this, you need to create
a connector, which stores the information required to push cases to {sn} via
{sn}'s https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/madrid/rest/c_TableAPI[Table API].

. Fill in the following:
* _Connector name_: A name for the connector.
* _URL_: The URL of the {sn} instance to which you want to send cases.
* _Username_: The username of the {sn} account used to access the {sn}
instance.
* _Password_: The password of the the {sn} account used to access the {sn}
instance.
. To represent a SIEM case as a {sn} incident, these SIEM case fields are
mapped to {sn} incidents fields:
** `Title`: Mapped to the {sn} `Short description` field. When an update to a
SIEM case title is sent to {sn}, the existing {sn} `Short description` field is
overwritten.
** `Description`: Mapped to the {sn} `Description` field. When an update to a
SIEM case description is sent to {sn}, the existing {sn} `Description` field is
overwritten.
** `Comments`: Mapped to the {sn} `Comments` field. When a new comment is added
to a SIEM case, a new comment is appended to the {sn} incident.
. Save the connector.

=== Change connectors

You can configure more than one connector, and change the connector used to
send cases to {sn}.

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Cases* -> *Edit external connection*.
. Select the required connector from the `Incident management system` list.
