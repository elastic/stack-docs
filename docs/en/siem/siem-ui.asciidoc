== SIEM UI

IMPORTANT: This document is a work in progress. 
It covers features scheduled for beta release in 7.2.

beta[]

After you have security monitoring <<install-siem,up and running>> and data is
streaming to {es}, check out the {siem-ui} in {kib}. You can monitor, identify,
track, and notate potential security issues in real time, or look back
historically to build a case.

The {siem-app} is powerful, flexible, and highly interactive. The UI elements
are designed to be discoverable, clickable, draggable and dropable, expandable
and collapsible, resizable, moveable, and so forth.

The *{kib} Query Language (KQL) bar* is available throughout the {siem-app} for
searching and filtering.

[[siem-overview-ui]]
=== Overview

The Overview page provides a high-level view into your security status. It can
help surface activity that requires further investigation.

Notice the *Timeline* on the right of the {siem-ui}. It is always available in its
collapsed or expanded state. Identify items you want to dig into, and drag and
drop them there. Those items are waiting for you when you are ready to start your
investigation.

[[hosts-ui]]
=== Hosts

The Hosts view provides summary and detailed information for the hosts you are
monitoring. You can drag and drop items of interest from the Hosts view to
Timeline for further investigation.

Interactive widgets let you drill down for deeper insights:

* Hosts
* Unique IPs
* User Authentications (success and failures)
* Uncommon Processes
* Events

*Hosts Detail* shows you summary information for a particular host, including
*Host ID, First Seen timestamp, Last Seen timestamp, IP and MAC addresses, OS,
*versions, machine type, and so forth.

[[index-config-hosts]]
==== Index configuration for hosts events

The default index patterns for hosts data are `auditbeat-*``, `winlogbeat-*``,
`filebeat-*``, and `packetbeat-*`. You can change the default index patterns in
{kib} -> Management -> Advanced Settings -> `siem:defaultIndex`.


[float]
[[network-ui]]
=== Network

The Network view provides summary and detailed information for the network
traffic you are monitoring. You can drag and drop items of interest from the
Network view to Timeline for further investigation.

[role="screenshot"]

Interactive widgets let you drill down for deeper insights:

* Top Talkers
* Top DNS Domains
* IP Details
* Domains
* Users
* Transport Layer Security certs

[float]
[[network-index-config]]
==== Index configuration for network events

The default index patterns for network data are  `filebeat-*``, and
`packetbeat-*`. You can change the default index patterns in {kib} -> Management
-> Advanced Settings -> `siem:defaultIndex`.


[float]
[[timelines-ui]]
=== Timelines

Use timelines to collect evidence and research suspicious activity during an
investigation. 

You can drag and drop items that warrant further investigation onto the Timeline
from any place in the {siem-ui}--from Overview, Hosts, Network pages, or even
from within Timeline itself.

A timeline is responsive and persists as you move through the {siem-app}
collecting data.

Add notes for your own use and to communicate your workflow and findings to
others. You can share a timeline, or pass it off to another person or team. You
can link to timelines from a ticketing system.


[float]
[[raw]]
==== See raw data 

You can click and expand events to see the raw data, including the raw {es} JSON.

[float]
[[narrow-expand]]
==== Narrow or expand your query 

You can specify `AND` and `OR` operations with an item's placement in the query
bar. Horizontal filters are `AND`-ed together. Vertical filters or sets are
`OR`-ed together. As you hover the item, you can see whether your placement is
on target to create an `AND` or `OR` statement.

[float]
[[pivot]]
==== Pivot your data 

Right-click an entry to access additional operations to exclude, temporarily
disable, or delete items from the query. For example, you can change an included
item to `exclude`.

[float]
[[row-renderer]]
==== Get more context for each event
As you build and modify your queries, you can see the results of your
interactions in the details pane below. 

As your query takes shape, a secondary line with more details is added to each
row. It shows relevant contextual information that helps tell the backstory of
the event. If you see a particular item that interests you, you can drag and
drop to the query bar for further introspection.

[float]
[[other]]
==== Other actions 

The {siem-app} is flexible and highly interactive.  As you would expect, the
{siem-app} lets you:

* add, remove, or resize columns. 
* save, open, and list timelines
* add notes to individual line items, and add a descriptions or summary
for the whole timeline
* pin line items for persistence

If you can think of an action or query you would like to try, the {siem-app}
likely supports it (or possibly will in a future release). Try clicking to
expand or collapse items, or dragging and dropping them to other areas to see
what happens.

Are there interactions that you would expect to see that aren't present? 
Let us know. We welcome your input.
