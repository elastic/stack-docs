= Logs ECS fields

This section lists https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-reference.html#_what_is_ecs[ECS fields] the {logs-app} uses to display data.

IMPORTANT: Beat modules (for example, {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules.html[{filebeat} modules])
are ECS-compliant so manual field mapping is not required, and all {logs-app}
data is automatically populated. If you cannot use {beats}, map your data to
{ecs-ref}[ECS fields] (see {ecs-ref}/ecs-converting.html[how to map data to ECS]).
You can also try using the experimental https://github.com/elastic/ecs-mapper[ECS Mapper] tool.

`@timestamp`::

Date/time when the event originated.
+
This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.
If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
Required field for all events.
+
type: date
+
example: `May 27, 2020 @ 15:22:27.982`
+
required: True

`container.id`::

Unique container id.
+
type: keyword
+
example: `data`
+
required: True

`event.dataset`::

Name of the dataset.
+
If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.
+
Itâ€™s recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.
+
type: keyword
+
example: `apache.access`
+
required: True, if you want to enable and use the *View in Context* feature.

`host.hostname`::

Hostname of the host.
+
It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine.
+
type: keyword
+
example: `Elastic.local`
+
required: True, if you want to use the {ml-features}.

`host.name`::

Name of the host.
+
It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use.
+
type: keyword
+
example: `MacBook-Elastic.local`
+
required: True

`kubernetes.pod.uid`::

Kubernetes Pod UID.
+
type: keyword
+
required: True

example: `8454328b-673d-11ea-7d80-21010a840123`

`log.file.path`::

Full path to the log file this event came from, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate.
+
If the event wasn't read from a log file, do not populate this field.
+
type: keyword
+
example: `/var/log/fun-times.log`
+
required: True, if you want to use the *View in Context* feature.

`message`::

For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
+
For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
+
If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.
+
type: text
+
example: `Hello World`
+
required: True
