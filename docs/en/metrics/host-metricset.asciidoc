== Host metrics

*CPU Usage*:: Average of `system.cpu.user.pct` added to the average of `system.cpu.system.pct` divided by `system.cpu.cores`

*Memory Usage*:: Average of `system.memory.actual.used.pct`

*Load*:: Average of `system.load.5`

*Inbound Traffic*:: Derivative of the maximum of `system.network.in.bytes` scaled to a 1 second rate

*Outbound Traffic*:: Derivative of the maximum of `system.network.out.bytes` scaled to a 1 second rate

*Log Rate*:: Derivative of the cumulative sum of the document count scaled to a 1 second rate.
This metric relies on the same indices as the logs.
