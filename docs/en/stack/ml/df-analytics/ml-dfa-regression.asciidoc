= Predicting numerical values with {regression}

:frontmatter-description: An introduction to {ml} {regression}, which enables you to predict numerical values in a data set.
:frontmatter-tags-products: [ml] 
:frontmatter-tags-content-type: [how-to] 
:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [analyze]

{reganalysis-cap} is a supervised {ml} process for estimating the relationships 
among different fields in your data, then making further predictions on 
numerical data based on these relationships. For example, you can predict the 
response time of a web request or the approximate amount of data that the 
server exchanges with a client based on historical data.

When you perform {reganalysis}, you must identify a subset of fields that you 
want to use to create a model for predicting other fields. _Feature variables_ 
are the fields that are used to create the model. The _dependent variable_ is 
the field you want to predict.

[discrete]
[[dfa-regression-algorithm]]
== {regression-cap} algorithms

//tag::regression-algorithms[]
{regression-cap} uses an ensemble learning technique called extreme gradient 
boost (XGboost) which combines decision trees with gradient boosting 
methodologies.

There are three types of {feature-vars} that you can use with these algorithms: 
numerical, categorical, or Boolean. Arrays are not supported.
//end::regression-algorithms[]

[discrete]
[[dfa-regression-problem]]
== 1. Define the problem

{regression-cap} can be useful in cases where a continuous quantity needs to be 
predicted. The values that {reganalysis} can predict are numerical values. If 
your use case requires predicting continuous, numerical values, then 
{regression} might be the suitable choice for you.

[discrete]
[[dfa-regression-environment]]
== 2. Set up the environment

Before you can use the {stack-ml-features}, there are some configuration
requirements (such as security privileges) that must be addressed. Refer to
<<setup>>.

[discrete]
[[dfa-regression-prepare-data]]
== 3. Prepare and transform data

{regression-cap} is a supervised {ml} method, which means you need to supply a 
labeled training data set. This data set must have values for the {feature-vars} 
and the {depvar} which are used to train the model. This information is used 
during training to identify relationships among the various characteristics of 
the data and the predicted value. This labeled data set also plays a critical 
role in model evaluation.

You might also need to {ref}/transforms.html[{transform}] your data to create a 
{dataframe} which can be used as the source for {regression}.

To learn more about how to prepare your data, refer to 
<<prepare-transform-data, the relevant section>> of the supervised learning 
overview.


[discrete]
[[dfa-regression-create-job]]
== 4. Create a job

{dfanalytics-jobs-cap} contain the configuration information and metadata 
necessary to perform an analytics task. You can create {dfanalytics-jobs} via 
{kib} or using the {ref}/put-dfanalytics.html[create {dfanalytics-jobs} API]. 

Select {regression} as the analytics type for the job, then select 
the field that you want to predict (the {depvar}). You can also include and 
exclude fields to/from the analysis.


[discrete]
[[dfa-regression-start]]
== 5. Start the job

You can start the job via {kib} or using the 
{ref}/start-dfanalytics.html[start {dfanalytics-jobs}] API. A {regression} job 
has the following phases: 

include::ml-dfa-shared.asciidoc[tag=dfa-phases]

After the last phase is finished, the job stops and the results are ready for 
evaluation.

include::ml-dfa-shared.asciidoc[tag=dfa-model-jvm]

[discrete]
[[ml-dfanalytics-regression-evaluation]]
== 6. Evaluate the result

include::ml-dfa-shared.asciidoc[tag=dfa-evaluation-intro]

You can measure how well the model has performed on your training data by using 
the `regression` evaluation type of the 
{ref}/evaluate-dfanalytics.html[evaluate {dfanalytics} API]. The 
<<ml-dfanalytics-mse,mean squared error (MSE)>> value that the evaluation 
provides you on the training data set is the _training error_. Training and 
evaluating the model iteratively means finding the combination of model 
parameters that produces the lowest possible training error.

Another crucial measurement is how well your model performs on unseen data. To 
assess how well the trained model will perform on data it has never seen before, 
you must set aside a proportion of the training set for testing (testing data). 
Once the model is trained, you can let it predict the value of the data points 
it has never seen before and compare the prediction to the actual value. This 
test provides an estimate of a quantity known as the 
_model generalization error_.

The {regression} evaluation type offers the following metrics to evaluate the 
model performance:

* Mean squared error (MSE)
* Mean squared logarithmic error (MSLE)
* Pseudo-Huber loss
* R-squared (R^2^)


[discrete]
[[ml-dfanalytics-mse]]
=== Mean squared error

MSE is the average squared sum of the difference between the true value and the 
predicted value. (Avg (predicted value-actual value)^2^).


[discrete]
[[ml-dfanalytics-msle]]
=== Mean squared logarithmic error

MSLE is a variation of mean squared error. It can be used for cases when the 
target values are positive and distributed with a long tail such as data on 
prices or population. Consult the <<dfa-regression-lossfunction>> page to learn 
more about loss functions.


[discrete]
[[ml-dfanalytics-huber]]
=== Pseudo-Huber loss

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss#Pseudo-Huber_loss_function[Pseudo-Huber loss metric] 
behaves as mean absolute error (MAE) for errors larger than a predefined value 
(defaults to `1`) and as mean squared error (MSE) for errors smaller than the 
predefined value. This loss function uses the `delta` parameter to define the 
transition point between MAE and MSE. Consult the 
<<dfa-regression-lossfunction>> page to learn more about loss functions.


[discrete]
[[ml-dfanalytics-r-squared]]
=== R-squared

R-squared (R^2^) represents the goodness of fit and measures how much of the 
variation in the data the predictions are able to explain. The value of R^2^ are 
less than or equal to 1, where 1 indicates that the predictions and true values 
are equal. A value of 0 is obtained when all the predictions are set to the mean 
of the true values. A value of 0.5 for R^2^ would indicate that the predictions 
are 1 - 0.5^(1/2)^ (about 30%) closer to true values than their mean.


[discrete]
[[dfa-regression-feature-importance]]
=== {feat-imp-cap}

{feat-imp-cap} provides further information about the results of an analysis and 
helps to interpret the results in a more subtle way. If you want to learn more 
about {feat-imp}, <<ml-feature-importance,click here>>.


[discrete]
[[dfa-regression-deploy]]
== 7. Deploy the model

The model that you created is stored as {es} documents in internal indices. In 
other words, the characteristics of your trained model are saved and ready to be 
deployed and used as functions. The <<ml-inference-reg,{infer}>> feature enables 
you to use your model in a preprocessor of an ingest pipeline or in a pipeline 
aggregation of a search query to make predictions about your data.

== Performing {reganalysis} in the sample flight data set

Let's try to predict flight delays by using the 
{kibana-ref}/get-started.html#gs-get-data-into-kibana[sample flight data]. The 
data set contains information such as weather conditions, flight destinations 
and origins, flight distances, carriers, and the number of minutes each flight 
was delayed. When you create a {regression} job, it learns the relationships 
between the fields in your data to predict the value of a _{depvar}_, which – in 
this case – is the numeric `FlightDelayMins` field. For an overview of these 
concepts, see <<ml-dfa-regression>> and <<ml-supervised-workflow>>.


[discrete]
[[flightdata-regression-data]]
=== Preparing your data

Each document in the data set contains details for a single flight, so this data 
is ready for analysis; it is already in a two-dimensional entity-based data 
structure. In general, you often need to {ref}/transforms.html[transform] the 
data into an entity-centric index before you analyze it.

To be analyzed, a document must contain at least one field with a supported data 
type (`numeric`, `boolean`, `text`, `keyword` or `ip`) and must not contain 
arrays with more than one item. If your source data consists of some documents 
that contain the {depvar} and some don't, the model is trained on the 
subset of the documents that contain it.

NOTE: The sample flight data is used in this example because it is easily
accessible. However, the data contains some inconsistencies. For example, a 
flight can be both delayed and canceled. This is a good reminder that the 
quality of your input data affects the quality of your results.


[discrete]
[[flightdata-regression-model]]
=== Creating a {regression} model

To predict the number of minutes delayed for each flight:

. Verify that your environment is set up properly to use {ml-features}. The
{stack} {security-features} require a user that has authority to create and 
manage {dfanalytics-jobs}. See <<setup>>.

. Create a {dfanalytics-job}.
+
--
You can use the wizard on the *{ml-app}* > *Data Frame Analytics* tab
in {kib} or the {ref}/put-dfanalytics.html[create {dfanalytics-jobs}] API.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-regression-job-1.jpg["Creating a {dfanalytics-job} in {kib}"]
--
.. Choose `kibana_sample_data_flights` as the source index.
.. Choose `regression` as the job type.
.. Optionally improve the quality of the analysis by adding a query that removes 
erroneous data. In this case, we omit flights with a distance of 0 kilometers or 
less.
.. Choose `FlightDelayMin` as the {depvar}, which is the field that we want to 
predict.
.. Add `Cancelled`, `FlightDelay`, and `FlightDelayType` to the list of excluded
fields. These fields will be excluded from the analysis. It is recommended to 
exclude fields that either contain erroneous data or describe the 
`dependent_variable`.
+
--
The wizard includes a scatterplot matrix, which enables you to explore the 
relationships between the numeric fields. The color of each point is affected by 
the value of the {depvar} for that document, as shown in the legend. You can use 
this matrix to help you decide which fields to include or exclude from the 
analysis.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flightdata-regression-scatterplot.png["A scatterplot matrix for three fields in {kib}"]

If you want these charts to represent data from a larger sample size or from a
randomized selection of documents, you can change the default behavior. However, 
a larger sample size might slow down the performance of the matrix and a
randomized selection might put more load on the cluster due to the more
intensive query.
--
.. Choose a training percent of `90` which means it randomly selects 90% of the
source data for training.
.. If you want to experiment with <<ml-feature-importance,{feat-imp}>>, specify
a value in the advanced configuration options. In this example, we choose to
return a maximum of 5 {feat-imp} values per document. This option affects the
speed of the analysis, so by default it is disabled.
.. Use a model memory limit of at least 50 MB. If the job requires more than
this amount of memory, it fails to start. If the available memory on the node is
limited, this setting makes it possible to prevent job execution.
.. Add a job ID (such as `model-flight-delay-regression`) and optionally a job 
description.
.. Add the name of the destination index that will contain the results of the 
analysis. In {kib}, the index name matches the job ID by default. It will
contain a copy of the source index data where each document is annotated with
the results. If the index does not exist, it will be created automatically.

[[flightdata-regression-results]]
=== Viewing {regression} results

Now you have a new index that contains a copy of your source data with 
predictions for your {depvar}.

When you view the results in {kib}, it shows the contents of the destination 
index in a tabular format. It also provides information about the analysis 
details, model evaluation metrics, total feature importance values, and a 
scatterplot matrix. Let’s start by looking at the results table:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-regression-results.jpg["Results for a {dfanalytics-job} in {kib}"]

In this example, the table shows a column for the {depvar} (`FlightDelayMin`), 
which contains the ground truth values that we are trying to predict. It also 
shows a column for the prediction values (`ml.FlightDelayMin_prediction`) and a 
column that indicates whether the document was used in the training set 
(`ml.is_training`). You can filter the table to show only testing or training 
data and you can select which fields are shown in the table. You can also enable 
histogram charts to get a better understanding of the distribution of values in 
your data.

If you chose to calculate {feat-imp}, the destination index also contains
`ml.feature_importance` objects. Every field that is included in the
{reganalysis} (known as a _feature_ of the data point) is assigned a {feat-imp}
value. This value has both a magnitude and a direction (positive or negative),
which indicates how each field affects a particular prediction. Only the most
significant values (in this case, the top 5) are stored in the index. However,
the trained model metadata also contains the average magnitude of the {feat-imp}
values for each field across all the training data. You can view this
summarized information in {kib}:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-regression-total-importance.jpg["Total {feat-imp} values in {kib}"]

You can also see the {feat-imp} values for each individual prediction in the
form of a decision plot:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-regression-importance.png["A decision plot for {feat-imp} values in {kib}"]

The decision path starts at a baseline, which is the average of the predictions
for all the data points in the training data set. From there, the feature
importance values are added to the decision path until it arrives at its final
prediction. The features with the most significant positive or negative impact
appear at the top. Thus in this example, the features related to the flight
distance had the most significant influence on this particular predicted flight
delay. This type of information can help you to understand how models arrive at  
their predictions. It can also indicate which aspects of your data set are most
influential or least useful when you are training and tuning your model.

If you do not use {kib}, you can see summarized {feat-imp} values by using the
{ref}/get-inference.html[get trained model API] and the individual values by
searching the destination index.

Lastly, {kib} provides a scatterplot matrix in the results. It has the same
functionality as the matrix that you saw in the job wizard. Its purpose is to
likewise help you visualize and explore the relationships between the numeric
fields and the {depvar} in your data.

=== Evaluating {regression} results

Though you can look at individual results and compare the predicted value
(`ml.FlightDelayMin_prediction`) to the actual value (`FlightDelayMins`), you
typically need to evaluate the success of the {regression} model as a whole.

{kib} provides _training error_ metrics, which represent how well the model
performed on the training data set. It also provides _generalization error_
metrics, which represent how well the model performed on testing data.

A mean squared error (MSE) of zero means that the models predicts the {depvar} 
with perfect accuracy. This is the ideal, but is typically not possible. 
Likewise, an R-squared value of 1 indicates that all of the variance in the 
{depvar} can be explained by the feature variables. Typically, you compare the 
MSE and R-squared values from multiple {regression} models to find the best 
balance or fit for your data.

For more information about the interpreting the evaluation metrics, see
<<ml-dfanalytics-regression-evaluation>>.

You can alternatively generate these metrics with the
{ref}/evaluate-dfanalytics.html[{dfanalytics} evaluate API].

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _ml/data_frame/_evaluate
{
 "index": "model-flight-delays-regression",
  "query": {
      "bool": {
        "filter": [{ "term":  { "ml.is_training": true } }]  <1>
      }

--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]

<1> Calculates the training error by evaluating only the training data.
<2> The field that contains the actual (ground truth) value.
<3> The field that contains the predicted value.

The API returns a response like this:

[source,console-result]
----  
{
  "regression" : {
    "huber" : {
      "value" : 30.216037330465102
    },
    "mse" : {
      "value" : 2847.2211476422967
    },
    "msle" : {
      "value" : "NaN"
    },
    "r_squared" : {
      "value" : 0.6956530017255125
    }
  }
}

Next, we calculate the generalization error:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _ml/data_frame/_evaluate
{
 "index": "model-flight-delays-regression",
  "query": {
      "bool": {
        "filter": [{ "term":  { "ml.is_training": false } }] <1>
      }
    },
 "evaluation": {
   "regression": {
     "actual_field": "FlightDelayMin",
     "predicted_field": "ml.FlightDelayMin_prediction",
     "metrics": {  
       "r_squared": {},
       "mse": {},
       "msle": {},
       "huber": {}                           
     }
   }
 }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]
<1> Evaluates only the documents that are not part of the training data.

When you have trained a satisfactory model, you can 
<<dfa-regression-deploy, deploy it>> to make predictions about new data.

If you don't want to keep the {dfanalytics-job}, you can delete it. For example,
use {kib} or the {ref}/delete-dfanalytics.html[delete {dfanalytics-job} API].
When you delete {dfanalytics-jobs} in {kib}, you have the option to also remove
the destination indices and {data-sources}.
