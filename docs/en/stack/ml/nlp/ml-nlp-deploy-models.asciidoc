If you want to perform {nlp} tasks in your cluster, you must deploy an
appropriate trained model. There is tooling support in
https://github.com/elastic/eland[Eland] and {kib} to help you prepare and manage
models.

[[ml-nlp-select-model]]
== Select a trained model

Per the <<ml-nlp-overview>>, there are multiple ways that you can use NLP
features within the {stack}. After you determine which type of NLP task you want
to perform, you must choose an appropriate trained model. 

The simplest method is to use a model that has already been fine-tuned for the
type of analysis that you want to perform. For example, there are models and
data sets available for specific NLP tasks on
https://huggingface.co/models[Hugging Face]. These instructions assume you're
using one of those models and do not describe how to create new models. For the
current list of supported model architectures, refer to <<ml-nlp-model-ref>>.

If you choose to perform {lang-ident} by using the `lang_ident_model_1` that is 
provided in the cluster, no further steps are required to import or deploy the 
model. You can skip to using the model in 
<<ml-nlp-inference,ingestion pipelines>>.


[[ml-nlp-import-model]]
== Import the trained model and vocabulary

IMPORTANT: If you want to install a trained model in a restricted or closed 
network, refer to 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/eland/current/machine-learning.html#ml-nlp-pytorch-air-gapped[these instructions].

After you choose a model, you must import it and its tokenizer vocabulary to
your cluster. When you import the model, it must be chunked and imported one
chunk at a time for storage in parts due to its size.

NOTE: Trained models must be in a TorchScript representation for use with
{stack-ml-features}.

https://github.com/elastic/eland[Eland] is an {es} Python client that provides a 
simple script to perform the conversion of Hugging Face transformer models to 
their TorchScript representations, the chunking process, and upload to {es}; it 
is therefore the recommended import method. You can either install the Python 
Eland client on your machine or use a Docker image to build Eland and run the 
model import script.

[[ml-nlp-import-docker]]
=== Import with Docker

If you want to use Eland without installing it, run the following command:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm --network host docker.elastic.co/eland/eland
```

The `eland_import_hub_model` script can be run directly in the docker command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm elastic/eland \
    eland_import_hub_model \
      --url $ELASTICSEARCH_URL \
      --hub-model-id elastic/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-conll03-english \
      --start
```

Replace the `$ELASTICSEARCH_URL` with the URL for your {es} cluster. Refer to 
<<ml-nlp-authentication>> to learn more.


[[ml-nlp-authentication]]
=== Authentication methods

The following authentication options are available when using the import script:

* username/password authentication (specified with the `-u` and `-p` options):

eland_import_hub_model --url https://<hostname>:<port> --es-api-key <api-key> ...
--------------------------------------------------
--


[[ml-nlp-deploy-model]]
== Deploy the model in your cluster

After you import the model and vocabulary, you can use {kib} to view and manage
their deployment across your cluster under **{ml-app}** > *Model Management*.
Alternatively, you can use the
{ref}/start-trained-model-deployment.html[start trained model deployment API].

You can deploy a model multiple times by assigning a unique deployment ID when 
starting the deployment. It enables you to have dedicated deployments for 
different purposes, such as search and ingest. By doing so, you ensure that the 
search speed remains unaffected by ingest workloads, and vice versa. Having 
separate deployments for search and ingest mitigates performance issues 
resulting from interactions between the two, which can be hard to diagnose.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-nlp-deployment-id-elser-v2.png["Model deployment on the Trained Models UI."]

It is recommended to fine-tune each deployment based on its specific purpose. To 
improve ingest performance, increase throughput by adding more allocations to 
the deployment. For improved search speed, increase the number of threads per 
allocation.

NOTE: Since eland uses APIs to deploy the models, you cannot see the models in
{kib} until the saved objects are synchronized. You can follow the prompts in
{kib}, wait for automatic synchronization, or use the
{kibana-ref}/machine-learning-api-sync.html[sync {ml} saved objects API].

When you deploy the model, its allocations are distributed across available {ml} 
nodes. Model allocations are independent units of work for NLP tasks. To 
influence model performance, you can configure the number of allocations and the 
number of threads used by each allocation of your deployment.

IMPORTANT: If your deployed trained model has only one allocation, it's likely 
that you will experience downtime in the service your trained model performs. 
You can reduce or eliminate downtime by adding more allocations to your trained 
models.

Throughput can be scaled by adding more allocations to the deployment; it 
increases the number of {infer} requests that can be performed in parallel. All 
allocations assigned to a node share the same copy of the model in memory. The 
model is loaded into memory in a native process that encapsulates `libtorch`, 
which is the underlying {ml} library of PyTorch. The number of allocations 
setting affects the amount of model allocations across all the {ml} nodes. Model 
allocations are distributed in such a way that the total number of used threads 
does not exceed the allocated processors of a node.

The threads per allocation setting affects the number of threads used by each 
model allocation during {infer}. Increasing the number of threads generally 
increases the speed of {infer} requests. The value of this setting must not 
exceed the number of available allocated processors per node.

You can view the allocation status in {kib} or by using the
{ref}/get-trained-models-stats.html[get trained model stats API]. If you want to
change the number of allocations, you can use the
{ref}/update-trained-model-deployment.html[update trained model stats API] after
the allocation status is `started`.

=== Adaptive allocations

[discrete]
[[infer-request-queues]]
=== Request queues and search priority

Each allocation of a model deployment has a dedicated queue to buffer {infer} 
requests. The size of this queue is determined by the `queue_capacity` parameter
in the 
{ref}/start-trained-model-deployment.html[start trained model deployment API]. 
When the queue reaches its maximum capacity, new requests are declined until 
some of the queued requests are processed, creating available capacity once 
again. When multiple ingest pipelines reference the same deployment, the queue 
can fill up, resulting in rejected requests. Consider using dedicated 
deployments to prevent this situation.

{infer-cap} requests originating from search, such as the 
{ref}/query-dsl-text-expansion-query.html[`text_expansion` query], have a higher 
priority compared to non-search requests. The {infer} ingest processor generates 
normal priority requests. If both a search query and an ingest processor use the 
same deployment, the search requests with higher priority skip ahead in the 
queue for processing before the lower priority ingest requests. This 
prioritization accelerates search responses while potentially slowing down 
ingest where response time is less critical.


[[ml-nlp-test-inference]]
== Try it out

When the model is deployed on at least one node in the cluster, you can begin to
perform inference. _{infer-cap}_ is a {ml} feature that enables you to use your
trained models to perform NLP tasks (such as text extraction, classification, or
embeddings) on incoming data.

The simplest method to test your model against new data is to use the
*Test model* action in {kib}. You can either provide some input text or use a 
field of an existing index in your cluster to test the model:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-nlp-test-ner.png[Testing a sentence with two named entities against a NER trained model in the *{ml}* app]

Alternatively, you can use the
{ref}/infer-trained-model.html[infer trained model API].
For example, to try a named entity recognition task, provide some sample text:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /_ml/trained_models/elastic__distilbert-base-cased-finetuned-conll03-english/_infer
{
  "docs":[{"text_field": "Sasha bought 300 shares of Acme Corp in 2022."}]
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]

In this example, the response contains the annotated text output and the
recognized entities:

[source,console-result]
----
{
  "inference_results" : [
    {
      "predicted_value" : "[Sasha](PER&Sasha) bought 300 shares of [Acme Corp](ORG&Acme+Corp) in 2022.",
      "entities" : [
        {
          "entity" : "Sasha",
          "class_name" : "PER",
          "class_probability" : 0.9953193407987492,
          "start_pos" : 0,
          "end_pos" : 5
        },
        {
          "entity" : "Acme Corp",
          "class_name" : "ORG",
          "class_probability" : 0.9996392198381716,
          "start_pos" : 27,
          "end_pos" : 36
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
// NOTCONSOLE

If you are satisfied with the results, you can add these NLP tasks in your
<<ml-nlp-inference,ingestion pipelines>>.
