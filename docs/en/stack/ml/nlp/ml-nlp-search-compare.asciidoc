The {stack-ml-features} can generate embeddings, which you can use to search in 
unstructured text or compare different pieces of text.

== Text embedding

Text embedding is a task which produces a mathematical representation of text 
called an embedding. The {ml} model turns the text into an array of numerical 
values (also known as a _vector_). Pieces of content with similar meaning have 
similar representations. This means it is possible to determine whether 
different pieces of text are either semantically similar, different, or even 
opposite by using a mathematical similarity function.

This task is responsible for producing only the embedding. When the 
embedding is created, it can be stored in a 
{ref}/dense-vector.html[dense_vector] field and used at search time. For 
example, you can use these vectors in a 
{ref}/knn-search.html[k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search] to achieve semantic 
search capabilities.

The following is an example of producing a text embedding:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
{
    docs: [{"text_field": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."}]
}
...
----------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE


The task returns the following result:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
...
{
    "predicted_value": [0.293478, -0.23845, ..., 1.34589e2, 0.119376]
    ...
}
