== Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning

For *{ess-trial}[Free Trial]*
and *https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Platinum License]* deployments,
Machine Learning functionality is available throughout the SIEM app. You can
view the details of detected anomalies within the `Anomalies` table widget
shown on the Hosts, Network and associated Details pages, or even narrow to
the specific daterange of an anomaly from the `Max Anomaly Score` details in
the overview of the Host and IP Details pages. Each of these interfaces also
offer the ability to drag and drop details of the anomaly to Timeline, such
as the `Entity` itself, or any of the associated `Influencers`.

==== Prebuilt Jobs

The SIEM app ships with prebuilt Machine Learning Jobs for detecting anomalies.
If your environment is configured with the appropriate indices (`auditbeat-*`
and `winlogbeat-*`) via {kib} -> Management -> Index Patterns, the jobs will be
installed on page load, and will be displayed within the `Anomaly Detection`
interface.
