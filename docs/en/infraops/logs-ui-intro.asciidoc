== {logs-ui} app

After you have set up logs streaming as part of <<install-infrastructure-monitoring, infrastructure monitoring>>, you can view real-time and historical logs in a compact, customizable display.
The log data is correlated with metric data in the <<infrastructure-ui-overview, {infra-ui} app>>, making it easier for you to diagnose problems.

You can stream the logs in real time, or view historical logs from a specified time range.

The search bar in the log viewer supports {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language].
You can enter ad hoc or structured queries.

For more information about using the {logs-ui} app, see the {kibana-ref}/xpack-logs.html[{logs-ui} app in the {kib} documentation].
