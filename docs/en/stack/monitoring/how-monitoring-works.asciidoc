== How monitoring works

Monitoring collects data from {es} nodes, Logstash nodes, {kib} instances, and
Beats.

In general, the {es} cluster you are monitoring controls where the monitoring
metrics for the stack are stored. By default, they are stored in local indices.

TIP: In production, we strongly recommend using a separate monitoring
Elasticsearch cluster. Using a separate monitoring cluster
prevents production cluster outages from impacting your ability to access your
monitoring data. It also prevents monitoring activities from impacting the
performance of your production cluster. For the same reason, we also
recommend to use a separate Kibana instance that is connected to the separate
monitoring cluster.

The following diagram illustrates a typical monitoring architecture with separate
production and monitoring clusters:

You can use {metricbeat} to collect and ship data about {es}, {kib}, {ls}, and
Beats rather than routing it through {es}.

For example:

If you have at least a gold license, you can route data from multiple production
clusters to a single monitoring cluster. For more information about the
differences between various subscription levels, see: https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions

IMPORTANT: In general, the monitoring cluster and the clusters being monitored
should be running the same version of the stack. A monitoring cluster cannot
monitor production clusters running newer versions of the stack. If necessary,
the monitoring cluster can monitor production clusters running the latest
release of the previous major version.

If you use {kib} to visualize data and administer the cluster, you might want to
create a dedicated {kib} instance for monitoring, rather than using a single
{kib} instance to access both your production cluster and monitoring cluster:
