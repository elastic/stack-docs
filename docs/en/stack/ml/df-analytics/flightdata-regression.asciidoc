=== Predicting flight delays with {reganalysis}

Let's try to predict flight delays by using the 
{kibana-ref}/add-sample-data.html[sample flight data]. We want to be able to use 
information such as weather and location of the destination and origin, flight 
distance and carrier to predict the number of minutes delayed for each flight. 
As it is a continuous numeric variable, we'll use {reganalysis} to make the 
prediction.

We have chosen this dataset as an example because it is easily accessible for 
{kib} users and the use case is relevant. However, the data has been manually 
created and contains some inconsistencies. For example, a flight can be both 
delayed and canceled. Please remember that the quality of your input data will 
affect the quality of results.

Each document in the dataset contains details for a single flight, so this data 
is ready for analysis as it is already in a two-dimensional entity-based data 
structure (_{dataframe}_). In general, you often need to 
{ref}/transforms.html[transform] the data into an entity-centric index before 
you analyze the data.

{regression-cap} is a supervised machine learning analysis and therefore needs 
to train on data that contains the ground truth for the `dependent_variable` 
that we want to predict. In this example, the ground truth is available in each 
document as the actual value of `FlightDelayMins`. In order to be analyzed, a 
document must contain at least one field with a supported data type (`numeric`, 
`boolean`, `text`, `keyword` or `ip`) and must not contain arrays with more than 
one item.

If your source data consists of some documents that contain a 
`dependent_variable` and some that do not, the model is trained on the 
`training_percent` of the documents that contain ground truth. However, 
predictions are made against all of the data. The current implementation of 
{reganalysis} supports a single batch analysis for both training and 
predictions.


[[flightdata-regression-model]]
==== Creating a {regression} model

To predict the number of minutes delayed for each flight:

. Create a {dfanalytics-job}.
+
--
You can use the wizard on the *Machine Learning* > *Data Frame Analaytics* tab
in {kib} or the {ref}/put-dfanalytics.html[create {dfanalytics-jobs}] API.

image::images/flights-regression-job.jpg[alt="Creating a {dfanalytics-job} in {kib}",width="50%",role="screenshot left",align="text-left"]

.. Choose `regression` as the job type.
.. Choose `kibana_sample_data_flights` as the source index.
.. Add the name of the destination index that will contain the results of the
analysis. It will contain a copy of the source index data where each document is
annotated with the results. If the index does not exist, it will be created
automatically.
.. Choose `FlightDelayMin` as the dependent variable, which is the field that we
want to predict with the {reganalysis}.
.. Choose a training percent of `90` which means it randomly selects 90% of the
source data for training.
.. Add `Cancelled`, `FlightDelay`, and `FlightDelayType` to the list of excluded
fields. These fields will be excluded from the analysis. It is recommended to 
exclude fields that either contain erroneous data or describe the 
`dependent_variable`.
.. Use the default memory limit for the job. If the job requires more than this 
amount of memory, it fails to start. If the available memory on the node is
limited, this setting makes it possible to prevent job execution.

. Start the job in {kib} or use the
{ref}/start-dfanalytics.html[start {dfanalytics-jobs}] API.

The job takes a few minutes to run. Runtime depends on the local hardware and 
also on the number of documents and fields that analyzed. The more fields and 
documents, the longer the job runs. It stops automatically when the analysis is
complete.

The job has four phases (reindexing, loading data, analyzing, and writing
results). When all the phases have completed, the job stops and the results are
ready to view and evaluate.

[[flightdata-regression-results]]
==== Viewing and evaluating {regression} results

Now you have a new index that contains a copy of your source data with 
predictions for your dependent variable.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-regression-results.jpg["Results for a {dfanalytics-job} in {kib}"]

In this example, the table shows a column for the dependent variable
(`FlightDelayMin`), which contains the ground truth values that we are trying to
predict with the {reganalysis}. It also shows a column for the prediction values
(`ml.FlightDelayMin_prediction`) and a column that indicates whether the
document was used in the training set (`ml.is_training`).

If you do not use {kib}, you can see the same information by using the standard
{es} search command to view the results in the destination index.

GET df-flight-delays/_search

// TEST[skip:TBD]

The snippet below shows a part of a document with the annotated results:

          ...
          "DestRegion" : "UK",
          "OriginAirportID" : "LHR",
          "DestCityName" : "London",
          "FlightDelayMin" : 66,
          "ml" : {
            "FlightDelayMin_prediction" : 62.527,
            "is_training" : false
          }
          ...
----

[[flightdata-regression-evaluate]]
Though you can look at individual results and compare the predicted value
(`ml.FlightDelayMin_prediction`) to the actual value (`FlightDelayMins`), there
are also metrics that you can use to evaluate the success of your {regression}
model as a whole.

The _training error_ metrics that you see in {kib} represent how well the
model performed on the training dataset. The _generalization error_ metrics
represent how well the model performed on previously unseen data (that is to
say, documents that were not used as training data).

For more information about the interpreting the evaluation metrics, see
<<ml-dfanalytics-regression-evaluation>>.

////
TBD: Can we provide tips for what are good MSE or R-squared values? For example:
A MSE of zero means that the models predicts the dependent variable with
perfect accuracy. This is the ideal, but is typically not possible. Likewise, an
R-squared value of 1 indicates that all of the variance in the dependent variable
can be predicted from the feature variables. Typically, you compare the MSE and
R-squared values from multiple {regression} models to find the best balance or
fit for your data.

You can alternatively generate these metrics with the
{ref}/evaluate-dfanalytics.html[{dfanalytics} evaluate API].

If you don't want to keep the {dfanalytics-job}, you can delete it. For example,
use {kib} or the {ref}/delete-dfanalytics.html[delete {dfanalytics-job} API].
When you delete  {dfanalytics-jobs}, the destination indices remain intact.
