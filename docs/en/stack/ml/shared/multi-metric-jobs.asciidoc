Conceptually, you can think of _multi-metric {anomaly-jobs}_ as running multiple
independent single metric jobs. By bundling them together in a multi-metric job,
however, you can see an overall score and shared influencers for all the metrics
and all the entities in the job. Multi-metric jobs therefore scale better than
having many independent single metric jobs. They also provide better results
when you have influencers that are shared across the detectors.
