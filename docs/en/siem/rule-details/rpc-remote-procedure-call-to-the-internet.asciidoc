=== RPC (Remote Procedure Call) to the Internet

This signal detects network events that may indicate the use of RPC traffic to
the Internet. RPC is commonly used by system administrators to remotely control
a system for maintenance or to use shared resources. It should almost never be
directly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by
threat actors as an initial access or back-door vector.
