A _{dataframe}_ is a transformation of data that has been indexed in elasticsearch. 
Use data frames to _pivot_ your data into a new entity centric index for example. 
By transforming and summarizing your data, it becomes possible to visualize and 
analyze it in alternative and interesting ways.

A lot of {es} indices are organized as a stream of events: each event is an individual 
document, for example a single item purchase. {dataframe-transforms-cap} enable 
you to summarize this data, bringing it into an organized, more analysis friendly 
format. For example, you can summarize all the purchases of a single customer (see 
the example below).

The {dataframe} feature enables you to define a pivot which is a set of features 
that transform the index into a different, more digestible format. Pivoting 
results in a summary of your data (which is the {dataframe} itself).

Defining a pivot consist of two main parts. First, you select one or more fields 
that your data will be grouped by. Principally you can select categorical 
fields (terms) for grouping. You can also select numerical fields, in this case, 
the field values will be bucketed using an interval you specify.

The second step is deciding how you want to aggregate the grouped data. When 
using aggregations, you practically ask questions about the index. There are 
different types of aggregations, each with its own purpose and output. To learn 
more about the supported aggregations and group-by fields, see 
{ref}/data-frame-transform-pivot.html[Pivot resources].

As an optional step, it's also possible to add a query to further limit the 
scope of the aggregation.

IMPORTANT: In 7.2, you can build {dataframes} on the top of a static indices. 
When new data comes into the index, you have to perform the transformation again 
on the altered data.

.Example

Imagine that you run a webshop that sells clothes. Every order creates a document 
that contains a unique order ID, the name and the category of the ordered product, 
its price, the ordered quantity, the exact date of the order, and some customer 
information (name, gender, location, etc). Your dataset contains all the transactions 
from last year.

If you want to check the sales in the different categories in your last fiscal year,
define a {dataframe} that is grouped by the product categories (women's shoes, men's
clothing, etc.) and the order date with the interval of the last year, then set 
a sum aggregation on the ordered quantity. The result is a {dataframe} pivot that 
shows the number of sold items in every product category in the last year.

IMPORTANT: Creating a {dataframe} leaves your source index intact. A new index will 
be created dedicated to the {dataframe}.
