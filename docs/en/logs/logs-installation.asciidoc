== Setting up logs monitoring

To set up logs monitoring, you need:

* An Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana (version 6.5 or later) with a basic license
// Add a link to what constitutes a basic license. And is this any different for the cloud?

* Appropriate {beats} shippers (version 6.5 or later) installed and enabled on each system you want to
monitor

If your data uses nonstandard fields, you may also need to modify some default configuration settings.

[float]
=== Get Elasticsearch and Kibana

To get started, you can use our hosted {es} Service on Elastic Cloud (recommended for new users), or you can install {es} and {kib} locally.

[float]
==== Use our hosted service

The hosted {es} Service is available on both AWS and GCP.
{ess-trial}[Try out the {es} Service for free].

[float]
==== Install {es} and {kib} locally

Alternatively, you can {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[install {es} and {kib} locally].
Follow the instructions to install {es}, and to install and start {kib}.

[float]
=== Install {beats} shippers

To start collecting logs data, you need to install and configure the {filebeat} {beats} shipper.

You can install and configure {beats} shippers for most kinds of data directly from {kib}, or you can install {beats} yourself.

[float]
==== Install {beats} from {kib}

To install {beats} from {kib}, on the machine where you want to collect the data, open a {kib} browser window.
In the *Add Data to Kibana* section, click *Add log data*.
Now follow the instructions for the type of data you want to collect.
The instructions walk you through the steps required to download, install and configure the appropriate Beats modules for your data.

[float]
==== Install {beats} yourself

If your data source doesn't have a {beats} module, or if you want to install {beats} the old fashioned way, follow the instructions in {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules-quickstart.html[{filebeat} modules quick start] and enable modules for the logs you want to collect.
If there is no module for the logs you want to collect, see the {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-getting-started.html[{filebeat} getting started] to learn how to configure inputs.

[float]
=== Enable modules

However you install {beats}, you need to enable the appropriate modules in {filebeat} to start collecting logs data.

// ++ I think some of this is still necessary even if you've followed the instructions to install Beats from Kibana.
// ++ The instructions there explain how to enable the module. Below, we enable more stuff.
// ++ What about if you are using Cloud? Is anything different?

To collect logs from your host system, enable:

* {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-system.html[{filebeat} `system` module]
* {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules.html[Other {filebeat} modules] needed for your environment, such as `apache2`, `redis`, and so on

To collect logs from Docker containers, enable:

* {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-input-docker.html[{filebeat} `docker` input]
* {filebeat-ref}/add-docker-metadata.html[{filebeat} `add_docker_metadata` processor]

To collect logs from Kubernetes pods, enable:

* {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-input-docker.html[{filebeat} `docker` input]
* {filebeat-ref}/add-kubernetes-metadata.html[{filebeat} `add_kubernetes_metadata` processor]

[float]
=== Configure your data sources

If your logs data has nonstandard fields, you may need to modify some configuration settings in {kib}, such as the index pattern used to query the data, and the timestamp field used for sorting.
You can use the {kibana-ref}/xpack-logs-configuring.html[*Settings* tab in the {logs-app}] to modify some common settings.
Alternatively, see {kibana-ref}/logs-ui-settings-kb.html[{logs} settings] for a complete list of logs configuration settings.

[float]
=== More about container monitoring

If you're monitoring Docker containers or Kubernetes pods, you can use autodiscovery to automatically change the configuration settings in response to changes in your containers.
This ensures you don't stop collecting data when your container configuration changes.
To learn how to do this, see {filebeat-ref}/configuration-autodiscover.html[{filebeat} autodiscover configuration].
