After you deploy trained models in your cluster, you can use them to make

{ref}/infer-trained-model-deployment.html[infer trained model deployment API],
{ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-inference-bucket-aggregation.html[inference bucket aggregation],
or add {ref}/inference-processor.html[inference processors] in your ingest
