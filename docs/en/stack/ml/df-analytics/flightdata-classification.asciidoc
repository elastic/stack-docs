= Predicting delayed flights with {classanalysis}

experimental::[]

Let's try to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not by using the 
{kibana-ref}/add-sample-data.html[sample flight data]. The data set contains 
information such as weather conditions, carrier, flight distance, origin,
destination, and whether or not the flight was delayed. When you create a
{dfanalytics-job} for {classanalysis}, it learns the relationships between the
fields in your data in order to predict the value of the _dependent variable_, 
which in this case is the boolean `FlightDelay` field. For an overview of these
concepts, see <<dfa-classification>> and <<ml-supervised-workflow>>.

[[flightdata-classification-data]]
== Preparing your data

Each document in the sample flight data set contains details for a single flight,
so this data is ready for analysis; it is already in a two-dimensional
entity-based data structure. In general, you often need to
{ref}/transforms.html[transform] the data into an entity-centric index before
you can analyze the data.

In order to be analyzed, a document must contain at least one field with a
supported data type (`numeric`, `boolean`, `text`, `keyword` or `ip`) and must
not contain arrays with more than one item. If your source data consists of some
documents that contain the dependent variable and some that do not, the model is
trained on the subset of documents that contain it.

TIP: The sample flight data set is used in this example because it is easily
accessible. However, the data has been manually created and contains some
inconsistencies. For example, a flight can be both delayed and canceled. This is
a good reminder that the quality of your input data affects the quality of your
results.

[[flightdata-classification-model]]
== Creating a {classification} model

To predict whether a specific flight is delayed:

. Create a {dfanalytics-job}.
+
--
You can use the wizard on the *{ml-app}* > *Data Frame Analytics* tab
in {kib} or the {ref}/put-dfanalytics.html[create {dfanalytics-jobs}] API.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-classification-job-3.png["Creating a {dfanalytics-job} in {kib} – advanced options"]

.. Choose `kibana_sample_data_flights` as the source index.
.. Choose `classification` as the job type.
.. Choose `FlightDelay` as the dependent variable, which is the field that we
want to predict with the {classanalysis}.
.. Add `Cancelled`, `FlightDelayMin`, and `FlightDelayType` to the list of
excluded fields. These fields will be excluded from the analysis. It is
recommended to exclude fields that either contain erroneous data or describe the 
`dependent_variable`.
.. Choose a training percent of `10` which means it randomly selects 10% of the
source data for training. While that value is low for this example, for many
large data sets using a small training sample greatly reduces runtime without 
impacting accuracy.
.. If you want to experiment with <<ml-feature-importance,{feat-imp}>>, specify
a value in the advanced configuration options. In this example, we choose to
return a maximum of 10 feature importance values per document. This option
affects the speed of the analysis, so by default it is disabled. 
.. Use the default memory limit for the job. If the job requires more than this 
amount of memory, it fails to start. If the available memory on the node is
limited, this setting makes it possible to prevent job execution.
.. Add a job ID and optionally a job description.
.. Add the name of the destination index that will contain the results of the
analysis. In {kib}, the index name matches the job ID by default. It will
contain a copy of the source index data where each document is annotated with
the results. If the index does not exist, it will be created automatically.

The job takes a few minutes to run. Runtime depends on the local hardware and 
also on the number of documents and fields that are analyzed. The more fields 
and documents, the longer the job runs. It stops automatically when the analysis is complete.

[[flightdata-classification-results]]
== Viewing {classification} results

Now you have a new index that contains a copy of your source data with 
predictions for your dependent variable.

When you view the {classification} results in {kib}, it shows contents of the
destination index in a tabular format:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-classification-results.png["Destination index table for a classification job in {kib}"]

In this example, the table shows a column for the dependent variable
(`FlightDelay`), which contains the ground truth values that you are trying to
predict. It also shows a column for the predicted values
(`ml.FlightDelay_prediction`), which were generated by the {classanalysis}. The
`ml.is_training` column indicates whether the document was used in the training
or testing data set. You can filter the table and the confusion matrix such that
they contain only testing or training data. You can also enable histogram charts
to get a better understanding of the distribution of values in your data.

If you want to understand how certain the model is about each prediction, you
can examine its probability and score (`ml.prediction_probability` and
`ml.prediction_score`). The higher these values are, the more confident the
model is that the data point belongs to the named class. If you examine the
destination index more closely in the *Discover* app in {kib} or use the
standard {es} search command, you can see that the analysis predicts the
probability of all possible classes for the dependent variable. The 
`top_classes` object contains the predicted classes with the highest scores.

`false`. For more details about these values, see
<<dfa-classification-interpret>>.
====

If you chose to calculate {feat-imp}, the destination index also contains
`ml.feature_importance` objects. Every field that is included in the
{classanalysis} (known as a _feature_ of the data point) is assigned a {feat-imp}
value. This value has both a magnitude and a direction (positive or negative),
which indicates how each field affects a particular prediction. Only the most
significant values (in this case, the top 10) are stored in the index. However,
the trained model metadata also contains the average magnitude of the {feat-imp}
values for each field across all the training data. You can view this
summarized information in {kib}:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-classification-total-importance.png["Total {feat-imp} values in {kib}"]

This type of information can help you to understand how models arrive at their
predictions. It can also indicate which aspects of your data set are most
influential or least useful when you are training and tuning your model.

If you do not use {kib}, you can see summarized {feat-imp} values by using the
{ref}/get-inference.html[get trained model API].

== Evaluating {classification} results

Though you can look at individual results and compare the predicted value
(`ml.FlightDelay_prediction`) to the actual value (`FlightDelay`), you
typically need to evaluate the success of your {classification} model as a
whole.

{kib} provides a _normalized confusion matrix_ that contains the percentage of
occurrences where the analysis classified data points correctly with their
actual class and the percentage of occurrences where it misclassified them.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-classification-evaluation.png["Evaluation of a classification job in {kib}"]

NOTE: As the sample data may change when it is loaded into {kib}, the results of 
the {classanalysis} can vary even if you use the same configuration as the 
example. Therefore, use this information as a guideline for interpreting your
own results.

If you want to see the exact number of occurrences, select a quadrant in the
matrix. You can optionally filter the destination index table to contain only 
testing data, which also affects the confusion matrix. Thus you can see how well
the model performs on previously unseen data. In this example, there are 2952
documents in the testing data that have the `true` class. 197 of them are
predicted as `false`; this is called a _false negative_. 1973 are predicted
correctly as `true`; this is called a _true positive_. The confusion matrix
therefore shows us that 33% of the actual `true` values were correctly
predicted and 67% were incorrectly predicted in the test data set.

Likewise if you select other quadrants in the matrix, it shows the number of
documents that have the `false` class as their actual value in the testing data
set. In this example, the model labeled 7530 documents out of 8802 correctly as
`false`; this is called a _true negative_. 1272 documents are predicted
incorrectly as `true`; this is called a _false positive_. Thus 86% of the actual
`false` values were correctly predicted and 14% were incorrectly predicted in
the test data set. When you perform {classanalysis} on your own data, it might
take multiple iterations before you are satisfied with the results and ready to
deploy the model.

You can also generate these metrics with the
{ref}/evaluate-dfanalytics.html[{dfanalytics} evaluate API]. For more
information about interpreting the evaluation metrics, see
<<ml-dfanalytics-classification>>.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _ml/data_frame/_evaluate
{
 "index": "model-flight-delay-classification",
   "query": {
    "term": {
      "ml.is_training": {
        "value": true  <1>
      }
    }
  },
 "evaluation": {
   "classification": {
     "actual_field": "FlightDelay",
     "predicted_field": "ml.FlightDelay_prediction",
     "metrics": {  
       "multiclass_confusion_matrix" : {}
     }
   }
 }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]
<1> We calculate the training error by evaluating only the training data.

Next, we calculate the generalization error that represents how well the model 
performed on previously unseen data:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _ml/data_frame/_evaluate
{
 "index": "model-flight-delay-classification",
   "query": {
    "term": {
      "ml.is_training": {
        "value": false  <1>
      }
    }
  },
 "evaluation": {
   "classification": {
     "actual_field": "FlightDelay",
     "predicted_field": "ml.FlightDelay_prediction",
     "metrics": {  
       "multiclass_confusion_matrix" : {}
     }
   }
 }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]
<1> We evaluate only the documents that are not part of the training data.

The returned confusion matrix shows us how many data points were classified 
correctly (where the `actual_class` matches the `predicted_class`) and how many 
were misclassified (`actual_class` does not match `predicted_class`):

[source,console-result]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "classification" : {
    "multiclass_confusion_matrix" : {
      "confusion_matrix" : [
        {
          "actual_class" : "false", <1>
          "actual_class_doc_count" : 8802, <2>
          "predicted_classes" : [
            {
              "predicted_class" : "false", <3>
              "count" : 7530 <4>
            },
            {
              "predicted_class" : "true",
              "count" : 1272
            }
          ],
          "other_predicted_class_doc_count" : 0
        },
        {
          "actual_class" : "true",
          "actual_class_doc_count" : 2952,
          "predicted_classes" : [
            {
              "predicted_class" : "false",
              "count" : 979
            },
            {
              "predicted_class" : "true",
              "count" : 1973
            }
          ],
          "other_predicted_class_doc_count" : 0
        }
      ],
      "other_actual_class_count" : 0
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The name of the actual class. In this example, there are two actual classes: 
`true` and `false`.
<2> The number of documents in the data set that belong to the actual class.
<3> The name of the predicted class.
<4> The number of documents that belong to the actual class and are labeled as
the predicted class.

When you have trained a satisfactory model, you can deploy it to make predictions
about new data. Those steps are not covered in this example. See
<<ml-inference>>.

If you don't want to keep the {dfanalytics-job}, you can delete it in {kib} or
by using the {ref}/delete-dfanalytics.html[delete {dfanalytics-job} API]. When
you delete {dfanalytics-jobs} in {kib}, you have the option to also remove the 
destination indices and index patterns.
