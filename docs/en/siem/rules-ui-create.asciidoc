=== Managing detection engine rules

Rules run periodically, and search the specified indices for 
documents that meet their criteria. On the Rules page, you can:

* <<create-rule-ui, Create rules>>
* <<manage-rules-ui, Clone, delete, disable, and enable rules>>
* <<import-export-rules-ui>>

[[create-rule-ui]]
==== Create a new rule

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detection Engine* -> *Manage rules*.
. Click *Create new rule*.
+
The *Create new rule* page is displayed.

. Set which indices the rule analyzes for signals:
+
.. Configured SIEM indices (*Management* -> *Advanced 
setting* -> *siem:defaultIndex*).
.. A custom list of indices.
. Use the filter and query fields to create the criteria used for detecting 
signals. For example, a rule that detects when a Microsoft Office product 
starts a process in a user folder uses the following query and filters:

* _Custom query_ `field: process.parent.name: EXCEL.EXE or process.parent.name: MSPUB.EXE or process.parent.name: OUTLOOK.EXE or process.parent.name: POWERPNT.EXE or process.parent.name: VISIO.EXE or process.parent.name: WINWORD.EXE`
* _Add filter_:
** *Field*: `event.action`
** *Operator*: `is`
** *Value* : `Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)`
. Click *Continue*.
+
The *About rule* pane is displayed.

. Fill in the following fields:
.. _Name_: The rule's name.
.. _Description_: A description of what the rule does.
.. _Severity_: Select the severity levels of signals created by the rule:
... `Low`: Signals that are of interest but generally not considered to be 
security incidents. Sometimes, a combination of low severity events can 
indicate suspicious activity.
... `Medium`: Signals that require investigation.
... `High`: Signals that require an immediate investigation.
... `Critical`: Signals that indicate a security incident has occurred.
.. _Risk score_: A numerical value between 0 and 100 that correlates with the _Severity_ level. General guidelines are:
... `21` represents low severity.
... `47` represents medium severity.
... `73` represents high severity.
... `99` represents critical severity.
.. _Reference URLs_ (optional): References to information that is relevant to 
the rule. For example, links to the relevant MITRE framework URL.
.. _False positives_ (optional): List of common scenarios that may produce 
false-positive signals.
.. _MITRE ATT&CK_ (optional): Relevant MITRE framework tactics and techniques.
.. _Tags_ (optional): Words and phrases used to categorize, filter, and search 
the rule.
. Click *Continue*.
+
The *Schedule rule* pane is displayed.

. Select how often the rule runs.
. Optionally, add look-back time to the rule. When defined, the rule searches 
indices with the additional time period.
+
For example, if you set a rule to run every 5 minutes with an additional
look-back time of 1 minute, the rule runs every 5 minutes but analyses the 
documents added to indices during the last 6 minutes. This overlap helps ensure 
signals are issued even when incoming host and network data is delayed.
. Save the rule with or without activation.

[[manage-rules-ui]]
==== Manage existing rules

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detection Engine*.
. Do one of the following:
* Click the actions icon (three dots), and select the required action.
* In the *Rule* column, select all the rules you want to perform an action on, and then the required action from `Batch actions` menu.


[[import-export-rules-ui]]
==== Import and export rules

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detection Engine* -> *Manage rules*.
. To import rules:
.. Click *Import rule*.
.. Drag and drop files containing the detection engine rules.
+
NOTE: Imported rules must be ndjson files.

. To export rules:
.. In the *All rules* table, select the rules you want to export.
.. Select *Batch actions* -> *Export selected*.
