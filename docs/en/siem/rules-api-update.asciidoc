[[rules-api-update]]
=== Update rule

Updates an existing signal detection rule.

You can use `PUT` or `PATCH` methods to update rules, where:

* `PUT` replaces the original rule and deletes fields that are not specified.
* `PATCH` updates the specified fields.

==== Request URL

`PUT <kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules`

`PATCH <kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules`

==== Request body

A JSON object with:

* The `id` or `rule_id` field of the rule you want to update.
* The fields you want to modify.

IMPORTANT: If you call `PUT` to update a rule, all unspecified fields are
deleted. You cannot modify the `id` or `rule_id` values.

For `PATCH` calls, any of the fields can be modified, whereas for `PUT` calls,
some fields are required.

events. |No, defaults to an empty array.

|from |String |Time from which data is analyzed each time the rule executes,
using a {ref}/common-options.html#date-math[date math range]. For example, 
`now-4200s` means the rule analyzes data from 70 minutes before its start 
time. |No, defaults to `now-6m` (analyzes data from 6 minutes before the start 
time).

|index |String[] |Indices on which the rule functions. |No, defaults to the
{siem-soln} indices defined on the {kib} Advanced Settings page (*Kibana* → 
*Management* → *Advanced Settings* → `siem:defaultIndex`).

|interval |String |Frequency of rule execution, using a
{ref}/common-options.html#date-math[date math range]. For example, `"1h"` 
means the rule runs every hour. |No, defaults to `5m` (5 minutes).

|machine_learning_job_id |String |{ml-cap} job ID the rule monitors for
anomaly scores. |Yes, for {ml} rules. Not allowed in `query` rules types.

|query |String |{kibana-ref}/search.html[Query] used by the rule to create a 
signal. |No. For `query` rules types, defaults to an empty string. Not allowed
in `machine-learning` rule types.

|language |String |Determines the query language, which must be
`kuery` or `lucene`. |No. For `query` rule types, defaults to `kuery`. Not
allowed in `machine-learning` rule types.

|output_index |String |Index to which signals detected by the rule are saved. 
|No, if unspecified signals are saved to `.siem-signals-<space_name>` index, 
where `<space_name>` is the name of the {kib} space in which the rule exists.

|saved_id |String |Kibana saved search used by the rule to create signals.
|Yes, for `saved_query` rules only.

|meta |Object |Placeholder for metadata about the rule. |No

|risk_score |Integer a|A numerical representation of the signal's severity from 
0 to 100, where:

* `0` - `21` represents low severity
* `22` - `47` represents medium severity
* `48` - `73` represents high severity
* `74` - `100` represents critical severity

|Yes

|max_signals |Integer |Maximum number of signals the rule can create during a
single execution. |No, defaults to `100`.

|name |String |The rule's name. |Yes

|note |String |Notes to help investigate signals produced by the rule. |No

|severity |String a|Severity level of signals produced by the rule, which must 
be one of the following:

* `low`: Signals that are of interest but generally not considered to be 
security incidents
* `medium`: Signals that require investigation
* `high`: Signals that require immediate investigation
* `critical`: Signals that indicate it is highly likely a security incident has 
occurred

|Yes

|tags |String[] |String array containing words and phrases to help categorize,
filter, and search rules. |No, defaults to an empty array.

// |to |String |Time to which data is analyzed each time the rule executes, using a
// {ref}/common-options.html#date-math[date math range]. For example, `"now-300s"` 
// means the rule analyzes data until 5 minutes before its starts time.

|throttle |String a|Determines how often actions are taken:

* `no_actions`: Never
* `rule`: Every time new signals are detected
* `1h`: Every hour
* `1d`: Every day
* `7d`: Every week

|Yes, when actions are used to send notifications.

|type |String a|Data type on which the rule is based:

* `query`: query-based conditions with or without additional filters
* `saved_query`: saved search, identified in the `saved_id` field
* `machine_learning`: rule based on a {ml} job's anomaly scores.

|Yes

|threat |<<threats-object-update, threat[]>> |Object containing attack 
information about the type of threat the rule monitors, see
{ecs-ref}/ecs-threat.html[ECS threat fields]. |No, defaults to an empty array.

|references |String[] |String array containing notes about or references to 
relevant information about the rule. |No, defaults to an empty array.

|version |Integer a|The rule's version number. If this is not provided, the 
rule's version number is incremented by 1.
