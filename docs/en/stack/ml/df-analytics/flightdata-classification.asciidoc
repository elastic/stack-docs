=== Predicting delayed flights with {classanalysis}

Let's try to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not by using the 
{kibana-ref}/add-sample-data.html[sample flight data]. The data set contains 
information such as weather conditions, carrier, flight distance, origin,
destination, and whether or not the flight was delayed. When you create a
{dfanalytics-job} for {classanalysis}, it learns the relationships between the
fields in your data in order to predict the value of the _dependent variable_, 
which in this case is the boolean `FlightDelay` field. For an overview of these
concepts, see <<dfa-classification>>.

[[flightdata-classification-data]]
==== Preparing your data

Each document in the sample flight data set contains details for a single flight,
so this data is ready for analysis; it is already in a two-dimensional
entity-based data structure. In general, you often need to
{ref}/transforms.html[transform] the data into an entity-centric index before
you can analyze the data.

In order to be analyzed, a document must contain at least one field with a
supported data type (`numeric`, `boolean`, `text`, `keyword` or `ip`) and must
not contain arrays with more than one item. If your source data consists of some
documents that contain the dependent variable and some that do not, the model is
trained on the subset of documents that contain it.

////
Each document in this sample data contains a `FlightDelay` field with a boolean 
value. {classification-cap} is a supervised {ml} analysis and therefore 
needs to train on data that contains the ground truth, known as the 
_dependent_variable_. In this example, the ground truth is available in each 
document as the actual value of `FlightDelay`.
////
////
By default, all of that subset of documents is used 
for training. However, you can choose to specify a percentage of the documents 
as your training data. Predictions are made against all of the data. The current 
implementation of {classanalysis} supports a single batch analysis for both 
training and predictions.
////
TIP: The sample flight data set is used in this example because it is easily
accessible. However, the data has been manually created and contains some
inconsistencies. For example, a flight can be both delayed and canceled. This is
a good reminder that the quality of your input data affects the quality of your
results.

[[flightdata-classification-model]]
==== Creating a {classification} model

To predict whether a specific flight is delayed:

. Create a {dfanalytics-job}.
+
--
You can use the wizard on the *Machine Learning* > *Data Frame Analaytics* tab
in {kib} or the {ref}/put-dfanalytics.html[create {dfanalytics-jobs}] API.

image::images/flights-classification-job.jpg[alt="Creating a {dfanalytics-job} in {kib}",width="50%",role="screenshot left",align="text-left"]

.. Choose `classification` as the job type.
.. Choose `kibana_sample_data_flights` as the source index.
.. Add the name of the destination index that will contain the results of the
analysis. It will contain a copy of the source index data where each document is
annotated with the results. If the index does not exist, it will be created
automatically.
.. Choose `FlightDelay` as the dependent variable, which is the field that we
want to predict with the {classanalysis}.
.. Choose a training percent of `10` which means it randomly selects 10% of the
source data for training. While that value is low for this example, for many
large data sets using a small training sample greatly reduces runtime without 
impacting accuracy.
.. Use the default feature importance values.
.. Add `Cancelled`, `FlightDelayMin`, and `FlightDelayType` to the list of
excluded fields. These fields will be excluded from the analysis. It is
recommended to exclude fields that either contain erroneous data or describe the 
`dependent_variable`.
.. Use the default memory limit for the job. If the job requires more than this 
amount of memory, it fails to start. If the available memory on the node is
limited, this setting makes it possible to prevent job execution.

The job takes a few minutes to run. Runtime depends on the local hardware and 
also on the number of documents and fields that are analyzed. The more fields 
and documents, the longer the job runs. It stops automatically when the analysis is complete.

[[flightdata-classification-results]]
==== Viewing {classification} results

Now you have a new index that contains a copy of your source data with 
predictions for your dependent variable.

When you view the {classification} results in {kib}, it shows contents of the
destination index in a tabular format:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-classification-results.jpg["Results for a {dfanalytics-job} in {kib}"]

In this example, the table shows a column for the dependent variable
(`FlightDelay`), which contains the ground truth values that you are trying to
predict. It also shows a column for the predicted values
(`ml.FlightDelay_prediction`), which were generated by the {classanalysis}. The
`ml.is_training` column indicates whether the document was used in the training
or testing data set. You can use this information to filter the table and the
confusion matrix such that they contain only testing or training data.

If you examine this destination index more closely in the *Discover* app in {kib}
or use the standard {es} search command, you can see that the analysis predicts
the probability of all possible classes for the dependent variable (in a
`top_classes` object). In this case, there are two classes: `true` and `false`.
The most probable class is the prediction, which is what's shown in the
{classification} results table. If you want to understand how sure the model is
about the prediction, however, you might want to examine the class probability
values. A higher number means that the model is more confident.

<2> The probability is a value between 0 and 1. The higher the number, the more 
confident the model is that the data point belongs to the named class.  In this 
example, `false` has a `class_probability` of 0.91 while `true` has only 0.08, 
so the prediction will be `false`.
<3> The `class_score` is a function of the probability. It is chosen so that the 
decision to assign the data point to the class with the highest score maximizes 
the minimum recall of any class.

[[flightdata-classification-evaluate]]
==== Evaluating {classification} results

Though you can look at individual results and compare the predicted value
(`ml.FlightDelay_prediction`) to the actual value (`FlightDelay`), you
typically need to evaluate the success of your {classification} model as a
whole.

{kib} provides a _normalized confusion matrix_ that contains the percentage of
occurrences where the analysis classified data points correctly with their
actual class and the percentage of occurrences where it misclassified them.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-classification-evaluation.jpg["Evaluation of a {dfanalytics-job} in {kib}"]

NOTE: As the sample data may change when it is loaded into {kib}, the results of 
the {classanalysis} can vary even if you use the same configuration as the 
example. Therefore, use this information as a guideline for interpreting your
own results.

If you want to see the exact number of occurrences, select a quadrant in the
matrix. You can optionally filter the table to contain only testing data so you
can see how well the model performs on previously unseen data. In this example,
there are 2952 documents in the testing data that have the `true` class. 914 of
them are predicted as `false`; this is called a _false negative_. 2038 are
predicted correctly as `true`; this is called a _true positive_. The confusion
matrix therefore shows us that 69% of the actual `true` values were correctly
predicted and 31% were incorrectly predicted in the test data set.

Likewise if you select other quadrants in the matrix, it shows the number of
documents that have the `false` class as their actual value in the testing data
set. In this example, the model labeled 7035 documents out of 8801 correctly as
`false`; this is called a _true negative_. 1766 documents are predicted
incorrectly as `true`; this is called a _false positive_. Thus 80% of the actual
`false` values were correctly predicted and 20% were incorrectly predicted in
the test data set.

For more information about interpreting the evaluation metrics, see
<<ml-dfanalytics-classification>>.

You can also generate these metrics with the
{ref}/evaluate-dfanalytics.html[{dfanalytics} evaluate API].
