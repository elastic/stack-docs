{anomaly-jobs-cap} contain the configuration information and metadata
necessary to perform an analytics task.

You can create {anomaly-jobs} by using the
{ref}/ml-put-job.html[Create {anomaly-jobs} API]. {kib} also provides the
following wizards to make it easier to create jobs:

A _single metric job_ is a simple job that contains a single _detector_. A
detector defines the type of analysis that will occur and which fields to
analyze. In addition to limiting the number of detectors, the single metric job
creation wizard omits many of the more advanced configuration options.

A _multi-metric job_ can contain more than one detector, which is more efficient
than running multiple jobs against the same data.

A _population job_ detects activity that is unusual compared to the behavior of
the population. For more information, see <<ml-configuring-populations>>.

A _categorization job_ groups log messages into categories and uses
<<ml-count-functions,count>> or <<ml-rare-functions,rare>> functions to detect
anomalies within them. See <<ml-configuring-categories>>.

An _advanced job_ can contain multiple detectors and enables you to configure all
job settings.

{kib} can also recognize certain types of data and provide specialized wizards
for that context. For example, if you added the sample web log data set, the
following wizard appears:

TIP: Alternatively, after you load a sample data set on the {kib} home page, you
can click *View data* > *ML jobs*. There are {anomaly-jobs} for both the sample
eCommerce orders data set and the sample web logs data set.

If you use {apm-get-started-ref}/overview.html[Elastic APM], {kib} also detects
this data and provides wizards for {anomaly-jobs}. For example:

If you use {filebeat-ref}/index.html[{filebeat}]
to ship access logs from your
http://nginx.org/[Nginx] and https://httpd.apache.org/[Apache] HTTP servers to
{es} and store it using fields and datatypes from the
{ecs-ref}/ecs-reference.html[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)], the following wizards
appear:

If you use {auditbeat-ref}/index.html[{auditbeat}] to audit process
activity on your systems, the following wizards appear:

[role="screenshot"]

Likewise, if you use the {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-system.html[{metricbeat} system module] to monitor your servers, the following
wizards appear:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-data-recognizer-metricbeat.jpg[A screenshot of the {metricbeat} job creation wizards]

These wizards create {anomaly-jobs}, dashboards, searches, and visualizations 
that are customized to help you analyze your {auditbeat}, {filebeat}, and
{metricbeat} data.
