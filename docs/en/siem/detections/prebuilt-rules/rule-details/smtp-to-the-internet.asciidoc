=== SMTP to the Internet

Detects events that may describe SMTP traffic from internal hosts to a host
across the Internet. In an enterprise network, there is typically a dedicated
internal host that performs this function. It is also frequently abused by
threat actors for command and control, or data exfiltration.

==== Potential false positives

NATed servers that process email traffic may false and should be excluded from
this rule as this is expected behavior for them. Consumer and personal devices
may send email traffic to remote Internet destinations. In this case, such
devices or networks can be excluded from this rule if this is expected behavior.
