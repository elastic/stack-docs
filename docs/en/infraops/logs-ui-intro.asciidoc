After you have set up logs monitoring and log data is streaming to {es}, you can view real-time and historic logs in a compact, customizable display.
The log data is correlated with metrics data in the <<infrastructure-ui-overview, {metrics-app>>, making it easier for you to diagnose problems.

You can stream the logs in real time, or view historical logs from a specified time range.

The search bar in the log viewer supports {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language].
You can enter ad hoc or structured queries.

For more information see the {kibana-ref}/xpack-logs.html[{logs-app}].
