=== {anomaly-detect-cap} algorithms

The {anomaly-detect} {ml-features} use a bespoke amalgamation of different
techniques such as clustering, various types of time series decomposition,
Bayesian distribution modeling, and correlation analysis. These analytics
provide sophisticated real-time automated {anomaly-detect} for time series data.

The {ml} analytics statistically model the time-based characteristics of your
data by observing historical behavior and adapting to new data. The model
represents a baseline of normal behavior and can therefore be used to determine
how anomalous new events are.

{anomaly-detect-cap} results are written for each <<ml-buckets,bucket span>>.
These results include scores that are aggregated in order to reduce noise and
normalized in order to rank the most mathematically significant anomalies. For
more information, see <<ml-bucket-results>> and <<ml-influencer-results>>.
