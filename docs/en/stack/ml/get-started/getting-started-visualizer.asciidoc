== Explore the data in {kib}

If you want to familiarize yourself with the sample data, you can click
*View data* > *Dashboard* for any of the data sets. For example, the Web Traffic dashboard for the sample web logs is a collection of charts, graphs, maps, and
other visualizations of the data in the `kibana_sample_data_logs` index.

Alternatively, you can use the {ml} Data Visualizer to explore the fields in
your data: 

. Open {kib} in your web browser. If you are running {kib} locally,
go to `http://localhost:5601/`.

TIP: The {kib} {ml-features} use pop-ups. You must configure your
web browser so that it does not block pop-up windows or create an
exception for your {kib} URL.

. Click **Machine Learning** in the side navigation.

. Select the **Data Visualizer**.

. Click **Select index** and choose the `kibana_sample_data_logs` index pattern.

. Use the time filter to select a time period that you're interested in
exploring. Alternatively, click
**Use full kibana_sample_data_logs data** to view the full time range of data.

. Optional: Change the number of documents per shard that are used in the
visualizations. There is a relatively small number of documents in the sample
data, so you can choose a value of `all`. For larger data sets, keep in mind
that using a large sample size increases query run times and increases the load
on the cluster.

The Data Visualizer lists the fields in two sections. The first section contains
the numeric ("metric") fields. The second section contains non-metric fields
(such as `keyword`, `text`, `date`, `boolean`, `ip`, and `geo_point` data types).

For metric fields, the **Data Visualizer** indicates how many documents contain
the field in the selected time period. It also provides information about the
minimum, median, and maximum values, the number of distinct values, and their
distribution. You can use the distribution chart to get a better idea of how
the values in the data are clustered. Alternatively, you can view the top values
for metric fields. For example:

For `date` fields, the **Data Visualizer** provides the earliest and latest field
values and the number and percentage of documents that contain the field
during the selected time period. For `text` fields, it provides example values
from the selected time period. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-gs-data-dates.jpg["Data Visualizer output for date fields in {kib}"]

TIP: Make note of these dates, since they are relative to when you added the
sample data and we'll use that information later in the tutorial.

For `keyword` and `ip` fields, the **Data Visualizer** provides the number of distinct
values, a list of the top values, and the number and percentage of documents
that contain the field during the selected time period. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-gs-data-keywords.jpg["Data Visualizer output for keyword and ip fields in {kib}"]

Likewise, for `geo_point` fields, the **Data Visualizer** provides the number of
distinct values, a list of example values, and the number and percentage of
documents that contain the field during the selected time period. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-gs-data-geo.jpg["Data Visualizer output for geo_point fields in {kib}"]

In this tutorial, we will create {ml} jobs that use many of these different
data types.
