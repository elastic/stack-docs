[[flightdata-regression]]
= Predicting flight delays with {reganalysis}

experimental::[]

Let's try to predict flight delays by using the 
{kibana-ref}/add-sample-data.html[sample flight data]. The data set contains
information such as weather conditions, flight destinations and origins, flight 
distances, carriers, and the number of minutes each flight was delayed. When you
create a {dfanalytics-job} for {reganalysis}, it learns the relationships
between the fields in your data in order to predict the value of a
_dependent variable_, which in this case is the numeric `FlightDelayMins` field.
For an overview of these concepts, see <<dfa-regression>> and
<<ml-supervised-workflow>>.

[[flightdata-regression-data]]
== Preparing your data

Each document in the data set contains details for a single flight, so this data 
is ready for analysis; it is already in a two-dimensional entity-based data 
structure. In general, you often need to 
{ref}/transforms.html[transform] the data into an entity-centric index before 
you analyze the data.

In order to be analyzed, a document must contain at least one field with a
supported data type (`numeric`, `boolean`, `text`, `keyword` or `ip`) and must
not contain arrays with more than one item. If your source data consists of some
documents that contain the dependent variable and some that do not, the model is
trained on the subset of the documents that contain it.

TIP: The sample flight data is used in this example because it is easily
accessible. However, the data has been manually created and contains some
inconsistencies. For example, a flight can be both delayed and canceled. This is
a good reminder that the quality of your input data affects the quality of your
results.

[[flightdata-regression-model]]
== Creating a {regression} model

To predict the number of minutes delayed for each flight:

. Verify that your environment is set up properly to use {ml-features}. If the
{stack} {security-features} are enabled, you need a user that has authority
to create and manage {dfanalytics-jobs}. See <<setup>>.

. Create a {dfanalytics-job}.

You can use the wizard on the *{ml-app}* > *Data Frame Analytics* tab
in {kib} or the {ref}/put-dfanalytics.html[create {dfanalytics-jobs}] API.

.. Choose `kibana_sample_data_flights` as the source index.
.. Choose `regression` as the job type.
.. Optionally improve the quality of the analysis by adding a query that removes erroneous data. In this case, we omit flights with a distance of 0 kilometers or less.
.. Choose `FlightDelayMin` as the dependent variable, which is the field that we
want to predict with the {reganalysis}.
.. Add `Cancelled`, `FlightDelay`, and `FlightDelayType` to the list of excluded
fields. These fields will be excluded from the analysis. It is recommended to 
exclude fields that either contain erroneous data or describe the 
`dependent_variable`.
.. Choose a training percent of `90` which means it randomly selects 90% of the
source data for training.
.. If you want to experiment with <<ml-feature-importance,feature importance>>,
specify a value in the advanced configuration options. In this example, we
choose to return a maximum of 5 feature importance values per document. This
option affects the speed of the analysis, so by default it is disabled.
.. Use the default memory limit for the job. If the job requires more than this 
amount of memory, it fails to start. If the available memory on the node is
limited, this setting makes it possible to prevent job execution.
.. Add a job ID and optionally a job description.
.. Add the name of the destination index that will contain the results of the 
analysis. In {kib}, the index name matches the job ID by default. It will
contain a copy of the source index data where each document is annotated with
the results. If the index does not exist, it will be created automatically.

The job takes a few minutes to run. Runtime depends on the local hardware and 
also on the number of documents and fields that are analyzed. The more fields
and documents, the longer the job runs. It stops automatically when the analysis
is complete.

[[flightdata-regression-results]]
== Viewing {regression} results

Now you have a new index that contains a copy of your source data with 
predictions for your dependent variable.

When you view the {regression} results in {kib}, it shows the contents of the
destination index in a tabular format:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-regression-results.png["Results for a {dfanalytics-job} in {kib}"]

In this example, the table shows a column for the dependent variable
(`FlightDelayMin`), which contains the ground truth values that we are trying to
predict with the {reganalysis}. It also shows a column for the prediction values
(`ml.FlightDelayMin_prediction`) and a column that indicates whether the
document was used in the training set (`ml.is_training`). You can filter the
table to show only testing or training data and you can select which fields are
shown in the table. You can also enable histogram charts to get a better
understanding of the distribution of values in your data.

If you chose to calculate feature importance, the destination index also
contains `ml.feature_importance` objects. Every field that is included in the
{reganalysis} (known as a _feature_ of the data point) is assigned a feature
importance value. However, only the most significant values (in this case, the
top 5) are stored in the index. These values indicate which features had the
biggest (positive or negative) impact on each prediction. In {kib}, you can see
this information displayed in the form of a decision plot:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/flights-regression-importance.png["A decision plot for feature importance values in {kib}"]

The decision path starts at a baseline, which is the average of the predictions
for all the data points in the training data set. From there, the feature
importance values are added to the decision path until it arrives at its final
prediction. The features with the most significant positive or negative impact
appear at the top. Thus in this example, the features related to the flight
distance had the most significant influence on this particular predicted flight
delay. This type of information can help you to understand how models arrive at  
their predictions. It can also indicate which aspects of your data set are most
influential or least useful when you are training and tuning your model.

If you do not use {kib}, you can see the same information by using the standard
{es} search command to view the results in the destination index.

[[flightdata-regression-evaluate]]
== Evaluating {regression} results

Though you can look at individual results and compare the predicted value
(`ml.FlightDelayMin_prediction`) to the actual value (`FlightDelayMins`), you
typically need to evaluate the success of the {regression} model as a whole.

{kib} provides _training error_ metrics, which represent how well the model
performed on the training data set. It also provides _generalization error_
metrics, which represent how well the model performed on testing data.

A mean squared error (MSE) of zero means that the models predicts the dependent 
variable with perfect accuracy. This is the ideal, but is typically not possible. 
Likewise, an R-squared value of 1 indicates that all of the variance in the 
dependent variable can be explained by the feature variables. Typically, you 
compare the MSE and R-squared values from multiple {regression} models to find
the best balance or fit for your data.

For more information about the interpreting the evaluation metrics, see
<<ml-dfanalytics-regression-evaluation>>.

You can alternatively generate these metrics with the
{ref}/evaluate-dfanalytics.html[{dfanalytics} evaluate API].

When you have trained a satisfactory model, you can deploy it to make predictions
about new data. Those steps are not covered in this example. See
<<ml-inference>>. 

If you don't want to keep the {dfanalytics-job}, you can delete it. For example,
use {kib} or the {ref}/delete-dfanalytics.html[delete {dfanalytics-job} API].
When you delete {dfanalytics-jobs} in {kib}, you have the option to also remove
the destination indices and index patterns.
