|Name |Description |Job |Datafeed

|linux_anomalous_network_activity_ecs
|Looks for unusual processes using the network which could indicate command-and-control, lateral movement, persistence, or data exfiltration activity.
//A process with unusual network activity can denote process exploitation or injection, where the process is used to run persistence mechanisms that allow a malicious actor remote access or control of the host, data exfiltration, and execution of unauthorized network applications.

|linux_anomalous_network_port_activity_ecs

//Rarely used destination port activity is generally unusual in Linux fleets, and can indicate unauthorized access or threat actor activity.

|linux_anomalous_network_url_activity_ecs
|Looks for an unusual web URL request from a Linux instance. Curl and wget web request activity is very common but unusual web requests from a Linux server can sometimes be malware delivery or execution.
//Wget and cURL are commonly used by Linux programs to download code and data. Most of the time, their usage is entirely normal. Generally, because they use a list of URLs, they repeatedly download from the same locations. However, Wget and cURL are sometimes used to deliver Linux exploit payloads, and threat actors use these tools to download additional software and code. For these reasons, unusual URLs can indicate unauthorized downloads or threat activity.

|linux_anomalous_process_all_hosts_ecs
|Looks for processes that are unusual to all Linux hosts. Such unusual processes may indicate unauthorized services, malware, or persistence mechanisms.
//Searches for rare processes running on multiple hosts in an entire fleet or network. This reduces the detection of false positives since automated maintenance processes usually only run occasionally on a single machine but are common to all or many hosts in a fleet.

|linux_anomalous_user_name_ecs
|Rare and unusual users that are not normally active may indicate unauthorized changes or activity by an unauthorized user which may be credentialed access or lateral movement.
// Searches for activity from users who are not normally active, which can indicate unauthorized changes, activity by unauthorized users, lateral movement, and compromised credentials. In organizations, new usernames are not often created apart from specific types of system activities, such as creating new accounts for new employees. These user accounts quickly become active and routine. Events from rarely used usernames can point to suspicious activity. Additionally, automated Linux fleets tend to see activity from rarely used usernames only when personnel log in to make authorized or unauthorized  changes, or threat actors have acquired credentials and log in for malicious purposes. Unusual usernames can also indicate pivoting, where compromised credentials are used to try and move laterally from one host to another.

[[security-network-jobs]]
== Security: Network

Detect anomalous network activity in your ECS-compatible network logs.

In the {ml-app} app, these configurations are available only when data exists
that matches the query specified in the
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/{branch}/x-pack/plugins/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_network/manifest.json[manifest file].
In the {security-app}, it looks in the {data-source} specified in the
{kibana-ref}/advanced-options.html#securitysolution-defaultindex[`securitySolution:defaultIndex` advanced setting]
for data that matches the query.

By default, when you create these jobs in the {security-app}, it uses a
{data-source} that applies to multiple indices. To get the same results if you
use the {ml-app} app, create a similar 
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/{branch}/x-pack/plugins/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_network/manifest.json#L7[{data-source}]

|high_count_by_destination_country
|Looks for an unusually large spike in network activity to one destination country in the network logs. This could be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Data exfiltration activity may also produce such a surge in traffic to a destination country which does not normally appear in network traffic or business work-flows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms may communicate with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an unusual destination country for the source network.

|high_count_network_denies
|Looks for an unusually large spike in network traffic that was denied by network ACLs or firewall rules. Such a burst of denied traffic is usually either 1) a misconfigured application or firewall or 2) suspicious or malicious activity. Unsuccessful attempts at network transit, in order to connect to command-and-control (C2), or engage in data exfiltration, may produce a burst of failed connections. This could also be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic.  Denial-of-service attacks or traffic floods may also produce such a surge in traffic.

|high_count_network_events
|Looks for an unusually large spike in network traffic. Such a burst of traffic, if not caused by a surge in business activity, can be due to suspicious or malicious activity. Large-scale data exfiltration may produce a burst of network traffic; this could also be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic.  Denial-of-service attacks or traffic floods may also produce such a surge in traffic.

|rare_destination_country
|Looks for an unusual destination country name in the network logs. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from a server in a country which does not normally appear in network traffic or business work-flows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms may communicate with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an unusual destination country for the source network.
