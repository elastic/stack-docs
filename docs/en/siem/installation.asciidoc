== Get up and running

beta[]

You need:

* An *Elasticsearch* cluster and *Kibana* (version 6.x or later) with a basic
license. See {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Getting started with the {stack}].
+
[TIP]
==============
You can skip installing {es} and {kib} by using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud. The {es} Service is available on both AWS and GCP.
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup[Try the {es}
Service for free].
==============

* *{beats}* shippers (version 6.x or later) installed on each system you want to
monitor

You might need to modify UI settings in {kib} to change default behaviors,
such as the index pattern used to query the data, and the timestamp field used
for sorting. For more information, see {kib}.

[[install-beats]]
=== Install {beats} shippers

To populate the {siem-ui} with hosts and
network data, you need to install and configure the following Beats:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat[{filebeat}] for forwarding and
centralizing logs and files
* https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/auditbeat[{auditbeat}] for monitoring
directories for file changes
* https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/winlogbeat[{winlogbeat}] for centralizing logs
* https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/packetbeat[{packetbeat}] for analyzing
network packets 

NOTE: {siem-soln} also works with custom and third-party data sources in addition to Beats.
{ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)] makes this possible. Any data tagged as `host.name`
can be displayed in {siem-soln}. 

[[install-option]]
==== {beats} installation options

To learn how to install and configure the shippers, do one of the following:

* Follow the instructions in the Add Data section of the {kib} home page. Click
*Add log data* or *Add metrics*, and follow the links for the types of data you
want to collect.

* If your data source isn't in the list, or you want to install {beats} the old
fashioned way:

** Follow the
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-getting-started.html[{metricbeat} getting started]
and enable modules for the metrics you want to collect.

** Follow the
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules-quickstart.html[{filebeat} modules quick start]
and enable modules for the logs you want to collect. If there is no module
for the logs you want to collect, see the
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-getting-started.html[{filebeat} getting started] to
learn how to configure inputs.


==== Enable modules and configuration options

For either approach, you need to enable modules in {filebeat} and {metricbeat}
to populate the {SIEM-ui} with data.

To populate the *Hosts* view and add logs, enable (NEEDS UPDATING):

* {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-system.html[{metricbeat} `system` module] (enabled by default)
* {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-system.html[{filebeat} `system` module]
* {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules.html[Other {filebeat} modules] needed for
your environment, such as `apache2`, `redis`, and so on
* {metricbeat-ref}/add-host-metadata.html[{metricbeat} `add_host_metadata` processor] (enabled by default)
* {metricbeat-ref}/add-cloud-metadata.html[{metricbeat} `add_cloud_metadata` processor] (enabled by default)
