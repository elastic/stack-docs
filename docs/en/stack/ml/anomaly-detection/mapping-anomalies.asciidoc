[[mapping-anomalies]]
= Mapping anomalies by location

If your data includes vector layers that are defined in the
{kibana-ref}/maps-connect-to-ems.html[{ems} ({ems-init})], your {anomaly-jobs}
can generate a map of the anomalies by location.

[[mapping-anomalies-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

If you want to view choropleth maps in **{data-viz}** or {anomaly-job} results,
you must have fields that contain valid vector layers
(such as {elastic-maps-service}/#file/world_countries[country codes] or 
{elastic-maps-service}/#file/usa_zip_codes[postal codes]).

This example uses the sample web logs data set. For more information, see
{kibana-ref}/get-started.html#gs-get-data-into-kibana[Add the sample data].

[[visualize-vector-layers]]
== Explore your data

If you have fields that contain valid vector layers, you can use the
**{data-viz}** in the **{ml-app}** app to see a choropleth map, in which each 
area is colored based on its document count. For example:

[[mapping-anomalies-jobs]]
== Create an {anomaly-job}

To create an {anomaly-job} in {kib}, click **Create job** on the
**{ml-cap} > {anomaly-detect-cap}** page and select an appropriate job wizard.
Alternatively, use the {ref}/ml-put-job.html[create {anomaly-jobs} API].

For example, use the multi-metric job wizard to create a job that analyzes the
sample web logs data set to detect anomalous behavior in the sum of the data 
transferred (`bytes` values) for each destination country (`geo.dest` values):

<4> Start the {dfeed}. Since the sample data sets often contain timestamps that
are later than the current date, it is a good idea to specify the appropriate
end date for the {dfeed}.

[[mapping-anomalies-results]]
== Analyze the results

After the {anomaly-jobs} have processed some data, you can view the results in
{kib}.

TIP: If you used APIs to create the jobs and {dfeeds}, you cannot see them
in {kib} until you follow the prompts to synchronize the necessary saved objects.

image::images/weblogs-anomaly-explorer-vectors.png[A screenshot of the anomaly count by location in Anomaly Explorer]

The **Anomaly Explorer** contains a map, which is affected by your swim lane
selections. It colors each location to reflect the number of anomalies in that
selected time period. Locations that have few anomalies are indicated in blue;
locations with many anomalies are red. Thus you can quickly see the locations
that are generating the most anomalies. If your vector layers define regions,
counties, or postal codes, you can zoom in for fine details.
