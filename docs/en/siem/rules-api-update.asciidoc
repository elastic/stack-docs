[[rules-api-update]]
=== Update rule

Updates an existing signal detection rule.

==== Request URL

`PUT /api/detection_engine/rules`

==== Request body

A JSON object with:

* The `id` or `rule_id` field of the rule you want to update.
* The fields you want to modify.

NOTE: You cannot modify the `id` or `rule_id` values.

Any of these fields can be modified:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Name |Type |Description

|description |String |The rule's description.

|enabled |Boolean |Determines whether the rule is enabled. 

|false_positives |String[] |String array used to describe common reasons why 
the rule may issue false-positive signals.

// |filter |Object |{kibana-ref}/field-filter.html[Filter] used by the rule to 
// create a signal |Yes, for filter-based rules only

|filters |Object[] |The {ref}/query-filter-context.html[query and filter 
context] array used to define the conditions for when signals are created from 
events.

|from |String |Time from which data is analyzed each time the rule executes,
using a {ref}/common-options.html#date-math[date math range]. For example, 
`now-4200s` means the rule analyzes data from 70 minutes before its start 
time.

|index |String[] |Indices on which the rule functions.

|interval |String |Frequency of rule execution, using a
{ref}/common-options.html#date-math[date math range]. For example, `"1h"` 
means the rule runs every hour.

|query |String |{kibana-ref}/search.html[Query] used by the rule to create a 
signal.

|language |String |Determines the query language, which must be
`kuery` or `lucene`.

|output_index |String |Index to which signals detected by the rule are saved. 

|saved_id |String |Kibana saved search used by the rule to create signals.

|meta |Object |Placeholder for metadata about the rule.

|risk_score |Integer a|A numerical representation of the signal's severity from 
0 to 100, where:

* `0` - `21` represents low severity
* `22` - `47` represents medium severity
* `48` - `73` represents high severity
* `74` - `100` represents critical severity

|max_signals |Integer |Maximum number of signals the rule can create during a
single execution.

|name |String |The rule's name. 

|severity |String a|Severity level of signals produced by the rule, which must 
be one of the following:

* `low`: Signals that are of interest but generally not considered to be 
security incidents
* `medium`: Signals that require investigation
* `high`: Signals that require immediate investigation
* `critical`: Signals that indicate it is highly likely a security incident has 
occurred

|tags |String[] |String array containing words and phrases to help categorize,
filter, and search rules.

// |to |String |Time to which data is analyzed each time the rule executes, using a
// {ref}/common-options.html#date-math[date math range]. For example, `"now-300s"` 
// means the rule analyzes data until 5 minutes before its starts time.

|type |String a|Data type on which the rule is based:

* `query`: query-based conditions with or without additional filters
* `saved_query`: saved search, identified in the `saved_id` field

|threat |<<threats-object-update, threat[]>> |Object containing attack 
information about the type of threat the rule monitors, see
{ecs-ref}/ecs-threat.html[ECS threat fields]. 

|references |String[] |String array containing notes about or references to 
relevant information about the rule.

|version |Integer a|The rule's version number. If this is not provided, the 
rule's version number is incremented by 1.

Enabling and disabling the rule does not increment its version number.
