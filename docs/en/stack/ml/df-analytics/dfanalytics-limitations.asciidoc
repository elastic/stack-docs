experimental[]

The following limitations and known problems apply to the 7.3 release of 
the Elastic {dfanalytics} feature:

[float]
[[dfa-ccs-limitations]]
=== {ccs-cap} limitation

{ccs-cap} is not supported in 7.3 for {dfanalytics}.

[float]
[[dfa-deletion-limitations]]
=== Deleting a {dfanalytics-job} does not delete the {dataframe} destination index

The {ref}/delete-dfanalytics.html[delete {dfanalytics-job} API] does not delete
the {dataframe} destination index. That index must be deleted separately.

[float]
[[dfa-update-limitations]]
=== Cannot update a {dfanalytics-job}

You cannot update {dfanalytics-cap} configurations. Instead, delete the 
{dfanalytics-job} and create a new one.

[float]
[[dfa-dataframe-size-limitations]]
=== {dataframe-cap} memory limitation

{dfanalytics-cap} can analyze {dataframes} that fit into the memory limit 
dedicated for {ml} processes. For general {ml} settings, see 
{ref}/ml-settings.html[{ml-cap} settings in {es}].

[float]
[[dfa-field-limitations]]
=== Field limitations in {dfanalytics}

Currently, {oldetection} only supports numeric features. Non-numeric fields will 
be excluded from the analysis by default. If such a field is explicitly included 
in the analysis, starting the {dfanalytics} should result in failure. Arrays are 
not supported either. Documents that contain analyzed fields with unsupported 
values will be skipped entirely.

[float]
[[dfa-missing-fields-limitations]]
=== Missing values in analyzed fields

If there are missing values in feature fields (fields that are subjects of the 
{dfanalytics}), then the document that contains the fields with the missing 
values will be skipped during the analysis.
