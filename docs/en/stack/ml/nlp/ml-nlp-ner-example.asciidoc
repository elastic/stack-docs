You can use these instructions to deploy a 
<<ml-nlp-ner,named entity recognition (NER)>> model in {es}, test the model, and 
add it to an {infer} ingest pipeline. The model that is used in the example is 
publicly available on https://huggingface.co/[HuggingFace].

[[ex-ner-deploy]]
== Deploy a NER model

include::ml-nlp-shared.asciidoc[tag=nlp-eland-clone-docker-build]

Select a NER model from the 
{ml-docs}/ml-nlp-model-ref.html#ml-nlp-model-ref-ner[third-party model reference list].
This example uses an 
https://huggingface.co/elastic/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-conll03-english[uncased NER model].

Install the model by running the `eland_import_model_hub` command in the Docker 
image:

[source,shell]
--------------------------------------------------
docker run -it --rm docker.elastic.co/eland/eland \
    eland_import_hub_model \
      --cloud-id $CLOUD_ID \
      -u <username> -p <password> \
      --hub-model-id elastic/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-conll03-english \
      --task-type ner \
      --start

--------------------------------------------------

You need to provide an administrator username and its password and replace the 
`$CLOUD_ID` with the ID of your Cloud deployment. This Cloud ID can be copied 
from the deployments page on your Cloud website.

[[ex-ner-test]]
== Test the NER model

Deployed models can be evaluated in {kib} under **{ml-app}** > 
**Trained Models** by selecting the **Test model** action for the respective 
model.

.**Test the model by using the _infer API**
[%collapsible]
====
You can also evaluate your models by using the 
{ref}/infer-trained-model-deployment.html[_infer API]. In the following request, 
`text_field` is the field name where the model expects to find the input, as 
defined in the model configuration. By default, if the model was uploaded via 
Eland, the input field is `text_field`.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _ml/trained_models/elastic__distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-conll03-english/_infer
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "text_field": "Elastic is headquartered in Mountain View, California."
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------

The API returns a response similar to the following:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "inference_results": [
    {
      "predicted_value": "[Elastic](ORG&Elastic) is headquartered in [Mountain View](LOC&Mountain+View), [California](LOC&California).",
      "entities": [
        {
          "entity": "elastic",
          "class_name": "ORG",
          "class_probability": 0.9958921231805256,
          "start_pos": 0,
          "end_pos": 7
        },
        {
          "entity": "mountain view",
          "class_name": "LOC",
          "class_probability": 0.9844731508992688,
          "start_pos": 28,
          "end_pos": 41
        },
        {
          "entity": "california",
          "class_name": "LOC",
          "class_probability": 0.9972361009811214,
          "start_pos": 43,
          "end_pos": 53
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
====

Using the example text "Elastic is headquartered in Mountain View, California.", 
the model finds three entities: an organization "Elastic", and two locations 
"Mountain View" and "California".

[[ex-ner-ingest]]
== Add the NER model to an {infer} ingest pipeline

You can perform bulk {infer} on documents as they are ingested by using an 
{ref}/inference-processor.html[{infer} processor] in your ingest pipeline. The 
novel _Les Misérables_ by Victor Hugo is used as an example for {infer} in 
the following example. 
https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/blob/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/nlp/data/les-miserables-nd.json[Download] 
the novel text split by paragraph as a JSON file, then upload it by using the 
{kibana-ref}/connect-to-elasticsearch.html#upload-data-kibana[Data Visualizer]. 
Give the new index the name `les-miserables` when uploading the file.

Now create an ingest pipeline either in the 
{ml-docs}/ml-nlp-inference.html#ml-nlp-inference-processor[Stack management UI] 
or by using the API:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _ingest/pipeline/ner
{
  "description": "NER pipeline",
  "processors": [
    {
      "inference": {
        "model_id": "elastic__distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-conll03-english",
        "target_field": "ml.ner",
        "field_map": {
          "paragraph": "text_field"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "script": {
        "lang": "painless",
        "if": "return ctx['ml']['ner'].containsKey('entities')",
        "source": "Map tags = new HashMap(); for (item in ctx['ml']['ner']['entities']) { if (!tags.containsKey(item.class_name)) tags[item.class_name] = new HashSet(); tags[item.class_name].add(item.entity);} ctx['tags'] = tags;"
      }
    }
  ],
  "on_failure": [
    {
      "set": {
        "description": "Index document to 'failed-<index>'",
        "field": "_index",
        "value": "failed-{{{ _index }}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "set": {
        "description": "Set error message",
        "field": "ingest.failure",
        "value": "{{_ingest.on_failure_message}}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------

The `field_map` object of the `inference` processor maps the `paragraph` field 
in the _Les Misérables_  documents to `text_field` (the name of the 
field the model is configured to use). The `target_field` is the name of the 
field to write the inference results to.

The `script` processor pulls out the entities and groups them by type. The end 
result is lists of people, locations, and organizations detected in the input 
text. This painless script enables you to build visualizations from the fields 
that are created.

The purpose of the `on_failure` clause is to record errors. It sets the `_index` 
meta field to a new value, and the document is now stored there. It also sets a 
new field `ingest.failure` and the error message is written to this field. 
{infer-cap} can fail for a number of easily fixable reasons. Perhaps the model 
has not been deployed, or the input field is missing in some of the source 
documents. By redirecting the failed documents to another index and setting the 
error message, those failed inferences are not lost and can be reviewed later. 
When the errors are fixed, reindex from the failed index to recover the 
unsuccessful requests.

Ingest the text of the novel - the index `les-miserables` - through the pipeline 
you created:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "les-miserables",
    "size": 50 <1>
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "les-miserables-infer",
    "pipeline": "ner"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The default batch size for reindexing is 1000. Reducing `size` to a smaller 
number makes the update of the reindexing process quicker which enables you to 
follow the progress closely and detect errors early.

Take a random paragraph from the source document as an example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "paragraph": "Father Gillenormand did not do it intentionally, but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic habit of his.",
    "line": 12700
}
--------------------------------------------------

After the text is ingested through the NER pipeline, find the resulting document 
stored in {es}:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /les-miserables-infer/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "line": 12700
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

The request returns the document marked up with one identified person:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
(...)
"paragraph": "Father Gillenormand did not do it intentionally, but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic habit of his.",
  "@timestamp": "2020-01-01T17:38:25.000+01:00",
  "line": 12700,
  "ml": {
    "ner": {
      "predicted_value": "Father [Gillenormand](PER&Gillenormand) did not do it intentionally, but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic habit of his.",
      "entities": [
        {
          "entity": "gillenormand",
          "class_name": "PER",
          "class_probability": 0.9452480789333386,
          "start_pos": 7,
          "end_pos": 19
        }
      ],
      "model_id": "elastic__distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-conll03-english"
    }
  },
  "tags": {
    "PER": [
      "gillenormand"
    ]
  }
(...)

[[ex-ner-visual]]
== Visualize results

You can create a tag cloud to visualize your data processed by the {infer} 
pipeline. A tag cloud is a visualization that scales words by the frequency at 
which they occur. It is a handy tool for viewing the entities found in the data.

In {kib}, open **Stack management** > **{data-sources-cap}** from the main menu, or use the {kibana-ref}/kibana-concepts-analysts.html#_finding_your_apps_and_objects[global search field], and create a new 
{data-source} from the `les-miserables-infer` index pattern. 

Open **Dashboard** and create a new dashboard. Select the 
*Aggregation based-type > Tag cloud* visualization. Choose the new {data-source} 
as the source.

Add a new bucket with a term aggregation, select the `tags.PER.keyword` field, 
and increase the size to 20. 

Optionally, adjust the time selector to cover the data points in the 
{data-source} if you selected a time field when creating it.

Update and save the visualization.
