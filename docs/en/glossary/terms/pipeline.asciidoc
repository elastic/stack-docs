[[glossary-pipeline]] pipeline::
A term used to describe the flow of <<glossary-event,events>> through the
{ls} workflow. A pipeline typically consists of a series of input, filter,
and output stages. <<glossary-input-plugin,Input>> stages get data from a source
and generate events, <<glossary-filter-plugin,filter>> stages, which are
optional, modify the event data, and <<glossary-output-plugin,output>> stages
write the data to a destination. Inputs and outputs support
<<glossary-codec-plugin,codecs>> that enable you to encode or decode the data as
it enters or exits the pipeline without having to use a separate filter.
