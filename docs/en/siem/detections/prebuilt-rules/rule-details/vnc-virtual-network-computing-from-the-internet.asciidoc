=== VNC (Virtual Network Computing) from the Internet

Detects network events that may indicate the use of VNC traffic from the
Internet. VNC is commonly used by system administrators to remotely control a
system for maintenance or to use shared resources. It should almost never be
directly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by
threat actors as an initial access or back-door vector.

==== Potential false positives

VNC connections may be received directly to Linux cloud server instances but
such connections are usually made only by engineers. VNC is less common than SSH
or RDP but may be required by some workflows such as remote access and support
for specialized software products or servers. Such workflows are usually known
and not unexpected. Usage that is unfamiliar to server or network owners can be
unexpected and suspicious.

network.transport:tcp and destination.port >= 5800 and
destination.port <= 5810 and not source.ip:(10.0.0.0/8 or 127.0.0.0/8
or 172.16.0.0/12 or 192.168.0.0/16 or "::1") and
