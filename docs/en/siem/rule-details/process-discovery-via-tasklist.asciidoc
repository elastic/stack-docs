Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a system.

*Severity*: low

*Tags*:

* D-SA
* Windows

*Version*: 1

==== Potential false positives

Administrators may use the `tasklist` command to display a list of currently
running processes. By itself, it does not indicate malicious activity. After
obtaining a foothold, it's possible adversaries may use discovery commands, like
`tasklist`, to get information about running processes.
