Feature processors enable you to extract process features from raw document 
fields. These features can then be used in model training, model deployment, and 
inference. The resulting features are ephemeral. This provides a mechanism to 
create features (that can be used at search and ingest) that do not take up 
space in the index. Additionally, it more tightly couples feature generation 
with the resulting model. This simplifies model management as now both the 
features and the model can follow the same life cycle easily.

Available feature processors:

* <<frequency-encoding>>
* <<multi-encoding>>
* <<ngram-encoding>>
* <<one-hot-encoding>>
* <<target-mean-encoding>>




[[frequency-encoding]]
== Frequency encoding


[[multi-encoding]]
== Multi encoding


[[ngram-encoding]]
== NGram encoding


[[one-hot-encoding]]
== One hot encoding


[[target-mean-encoding]]
== Target mean encoding
