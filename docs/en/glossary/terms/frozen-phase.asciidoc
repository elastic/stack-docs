[[glossary-frozen-phase]] frozen phase::
Fourth possible phase in the <<glossary-index-lifecycle,index lifecycle>>. In
the frozen phase, an <<glossary-index,index>> is no longer updated and
<<glossary-query,queried>> rarely. The information still needs to be searchable,
but itâ€™s okay if those queries are extremely slow. See
{ref}/ilm-index-lifecycle.html[Index lifecycle].
