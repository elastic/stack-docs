== Upgrade your deployment or cluster

Before you can upgrade your deployment or cluster to 9.0.0, ensure you're <<prepare-upgrade-9.0,prepared to upgrade>>. 

The procedures you follow to upgrade depend whether you've installed Elastic components using Elastic-managed infrastructure or self-managed infrastructure. 

If you're running Elastic-managed infrastructure, your options are: 

* Upgrading on Elastic Cloud Hosted (ECH)
* Upgrading on {serverless-full} (updates are automatic and require no user management)

If you're running your own self-managed infrastructure â€“ either on-prem or on public cloud, your options are: 

* Upgrading the {stack} (upgrade each component individually)
* Upgrading {ece} (ECE)
* Upgrading {eck} (ECK)

Before you begin upgrading on ECE or ECK, ensure your orchestrator is compatible with {version}.
