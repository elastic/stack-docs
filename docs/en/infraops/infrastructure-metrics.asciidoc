== Infrastructure metrics

The metrics listed below are provided by the {beats} shippers.
// ++ what does the sentence below mean? What does the reader need to do?
Each system type requires their corresponding identity field to be in the same event document:

* Hosts require `host.name`
* Docker containers require `container.id`
* Kubernetes pods require `kubernetes.pod.uid`

// + I think this bit applies to the View Metrics page, not the Infrastructure home page.
// ++ What does this mean, and what does the reader need to do about it, if anything to ensure the "required field" is available?
For the metrics detail page, `event.dataset` is a required field. This field is a combination of `metricset.module`, which is the Metricbeat module name, and `metricset.name`, which is the metricset name.

[float]
=== Host Metrics

*CPU Usage*:: Average of `system.cpu.user.pct` added to the average of `system.cpu.system.pct` divided by `system.cpu.cores`

*Memory Usage*:: Average of `system.memory.actual.used.pct`

*Load*:: Average of `system.load.5`

*Inbound Traffic*:: Derivative of the maximum of `system.network.in.bytes` scaled to a 1 second rate

*Outbound Traffic*:: Derivative of the maxoimum of `system.network.out.bytes` scaled to a 1 second rate

*Log Rate*:: Derivative of the cumulative sum of the document count scaled to a 1 second rate.
This metric relies on the same indices as the logs.

[float]
=== Docker Container Metrics

*CPU Usage*:: Average of `docker.cpu.total.pct`

*Memory Usage*:: Average of `docker.memory.usage.pct`

*Inbound Traffic*:: Derivative of the max of `docker.network.in.bytes` scaled to a 1 second rate

*Outbound Traffic*:: Derivative of the max of `docker.network.out.bytes` scaled to a 1 second rate

[float]
=== Kubernetes Pod Metrics

*CPU Usage*:: Average of `kubernetes.pod.cpu.usage.node.pct`

*Memory Usage*:: Average of `kubernetes.pod.memory.usage.node.pct`

*Inbound Traffic*:: Derivative of the max of `kubernetes.pod.network.rx.bytes` scaled to a 1 second rate

*Outbound Traffic*:: Derivative of the max of `kubernetes.pod.network.tx.bytes` scaled to a 1 second rate
