[[glossary-zone]] availability zone::
Contains resources available to a {ece} installation that are isolated from
other availability zones to safeguard against failure. Could be a rack, a server
zone or some other logical constraint that creates a failure boundary. In a
highly available cluster, the nodes of a cluster are spread across two or three
availability zones to ensure that the cluster can survive the failure of an
entire availability zone. Also see
{ece-ref}/ece-ha.html[Fault Tolerance (High Availability)].
