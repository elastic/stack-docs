EmbEddings from bidirEctional Encoder rEpresentations - or E5 -  is a {nlp} 
model that enables you to perform multi-lingual semantic search by using dense 
vector representations. This model is recommended for non-English language 
documents and queries. If you want to perform semantic search on English 
language documents, use the <<ml-nlp-elser>> model.

{ref}/semantic-search.html[Semantic search] provides you search results based on 
contextual meaning and user intent, rather than exact keyword matches.

E5 has two versions: one cross-platform version which runs on any hardware 
and one version which is optimized for Intel® silicon. The 
**Model Management** > **Trained Models** page shows you which version of E5 is 
recommended to deploy based on your cluster's hardware. However, the
recommended way to use E5 is through the 
{ref}/infer-service-elasticsearch.html[{infer} API] as a service which makes it
easier to download and deploy the model and you don't need to select from
different versions. 

Refer to the model cards of the 
https://huggingface.co/elastic/multilingual-e5-small[multilingual-e5-small] and 
the 
https://huggingface.co/elastic/multilingual-e5-small-optimized[multilingual-e5-small-optimized]
models on HuggingFace for further information including licensing.

[[e5-req]]
== Requirements

To use E5, you must have the {subscriptions}[appropriate subscription] level 
for semantic search or the trial period activated.

[[download-deploy-e5]]
== Download and deploy E5

The easiest and recommended way to download and deploy E5 is to use the {ref}/inference-apis.html[{infer} API].

1. In {kib}, navigate to the **Dev Console**.
2. Create an {infer} endpoint with the `elasticsearch` service by running the following API request:
+
--
[source,console]
----------------------------------
PUT _inference/text_embedding/my-e5-model
{
  "service": "elasticsearch",
  "service_settings": {
    "num_allocations": 1,
    "num_threads": 1,
    "model_id": ".multilingual-e5-small"
  }
}
----------------------------------
--
The API request automatically initiates the model download and then deploy the model.

Refer to the {ref}/infer-service-elasticsearch.html[`elasticsearch` {infer} service documentation] to learn more about the available settings.

After you created the E5 {infer} endpoint, it's ready to be used for semantic search.
The easiest way to perform semantic search in the {stack} is to {ref}/semantic-search-semantic-text.html[follow the `semantic_text` workflow].

[[alternative-download-deploy-e5]]
=== Alternative methods to download and deploy E5

You can also download and deploy the E5 model either from **{ml-app}** > **Trained Models**, from **Search** > **Indices**, or by using the trained models API in Dev Console.

NOTE: For most cases, the preferred version is the **Intel and Linux optimized** model, it is recommended to download and deploy that version.

silicon. You can see which model is recommended to use based on your hardware 
configuration.
2. Click the **Add trained model** button. Select the E5 model version you want 
to use in the opening modal window. The model that is recommended for you based 
on your hardware configuration is highlighted. Click **Download**. You can check 
the download status on the **Notifications** page.

[[elasticsearch-e5]]
==== Using the search indices UI

Alternatively, you can download and deploy the E5 model to an {infer} pipeline 
using the search indices UI.

1. In {kib}, navigate to **Search** > **Indices**.
2. Select the index from the list that has an {infer} pipeline in which you want 
to use E5.
3. Navigate to the **Pipelines** tab.
4. Under **{ml-app} {infer-cap} Pipelines**, click the **Deploy** button in the 
**Improve your results with E5** section to begin downloading the E5 model. This 
may take a few minutes depending on your network. 
+

5. Once the model is downloaded, click the **Start single-threaded** button to 
start the model with basic configuration or select the **Fine-tune performance** 
option to navigate to the **Trained Models** page where you can configure the 
model deployment.

[[dev-console-e5]]
==== Using the trained models API in Dev Console

1. In {kib}, navigate to the **Dev Console**.
2. Create the E5 model configuration by running the following API call:

[source,console]
----------------------------------
PUT _ml/trained_models/.multilingual-e5-small
{
  "input": {
	"field_names": ["text_field"]
  }
}
----------------------------------

The API call automatically initiates the model download if the model is not 
downloaded yet.
--
3. Deploy the model by using the 
{ref}/start-trained-model-deployment.html[start trained model deployment API] 
with a delpoyment ID:
+
--
[source,console]

[[air-gapped-install-e5]]
== Deploy the E5 model in an air-gapped environment

If you want to install E5 in an air-gapped environment, you have the following 
options:
* put the model artifacts into a directory inside the config directory on all 
master-eligible nodes (for `multilingual-e5-small` and
`multilingual-e5-small-linux-x86-64`)
* install the model by using HuggingFace (for `multilingual-e5-small` model 
only).


[discrete]
[[e5-model-artifacts]]
=== Model artifact files

For the `multilingual-e5-small` model, you need the following files in your
system:
```
https://ml-models.elastic.co/multilingual-e5-small.metadata.json
https://ml-models.elastic.co/multilingual-e5-small.pt
https://ml-models.elastic.co/multilingual-e5-small.vocab.json
```

For the optimized version, you need the following files in your system:
```
https://ml-models.elastic.co/multilingual-e5-small_linux-x86_64.metadata.json
https://ml-models.elastic.co/multilingual-e5-small_linux-x86_64.pt
https://ml-models.elastic.co/multilingual-e5-small_linux-x86_64.vocab.json
```


[discrete]
=== Using file-based access

For a file-based access, follow these steps:

. Download the <<e5-model-artifacts,model artifact files>>. 
. Put the files into a `models` subdirectory inside the `config` directory of 
your {es} deployment.
. Point your {es} deployment to the model directory by adding the following line
to the `config/elasticsearch.yml` file:
+
--
```
xpack.ml.model_repository: file://${path.home}/config/models/`
```
--
. Repeat step 2 and step 3 on all master-eligible nodes.
. {ref}/restart-cluster.html#restart-cluster-rolling[Restart] the 
master-eligible nodes one by one.
. Navigate to the **Trained Models** page in {kib}, E5 can be found in the 
list of trained models.
. Click the **Add trained model** button, select the E5 model version you 
downloaded in step 1 and want to deploy and click **Download**. The selected 
model will be downloaded from the model directory where you put in step 2.
. After the download is finished, start the deployment by clicking the 
**Start deployment** button.
. Provide a deployment ID, select the priority, and set the number of 
allocations and threads per allocation values.
. Click **Start**.


[discrete]
=== Using the HuggingFace repository

You can install the `multilingual-e5-small` model in a restricted or closed
network by pointing the `eland_import_hub_model` script to the model's local
files.

For an offline install, the model first needs to be cloned locally, Git and 
https://git-lfs.com/[Git Large File Storage] are required to be installed in 
your system.

1. Clone the E5 model from Hugging Face by using the model URL. 
+
--
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://huggingface.co/elastic/multilingual-e5-small
----
The command results in a local copy of the model in the `multilingual-e5-small`
directory.
--

2. Use the `eland_import_hub_model` script with the `--hub-model-id` set to the 
directory of the cloned model to install it:
+
--
[source,bash]
----
eland_import_hub_model \
      --url 'XXXX' \
      --hub-model-id /PATH/TO/MODEL \
      --task-type text_embedding \
      --es-username elastic --es-password XXX \
      --es-model-id multilingual-e5-small
----

If you use the Docker image to run `eland_import_hub_model` you must bind mount 
the model directory, so the container can read the files.
[source,bash]
----
docker run --mount type=bind,source=/PATH/TO/MODELS,destination=/models,readonly -it --rm docker.elastic.co/eland/eland \
    eland_import_hub_model \
      --url 'XXXX' \
      --hub-model-id /models/multilingual-e5-small \
      --task-type text_embedding \
      --es-username elastic --es-password XXX \
      --es-model-id multilingual-e5-small
----
Once it's uploaded to {es}, the model will have the ID specified by 
`--es-model-id`. If it is not set, the model ID is derived from 
`--hub-model-id`; spaces and path delimiters are converted to double 
underscores `__`.
