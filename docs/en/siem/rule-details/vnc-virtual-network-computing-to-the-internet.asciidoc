=== VNC (Virtual Network Computing) to the Internet

Detects network events that may indicate the use of VNC traffic to the Internet.
VNC is commonly used by system administrators to remotely control a system for
maintenance or to use shared resources. It should almost never be directly
exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by threat
actors as an initial access or back-door vector.

==== Potential false positives

VNC connections may be made directly to Linux cloud server instances but such
connections are usually made only by engineers. VNC is less common than SSH or
RDP but may be required by some work flows such as remote access and support for
specialized software products or servers. Such workflows are usually known and
not unexpected. Usage that is unfamiliar to server or network owners can be
unexpected and suspicious.

destination.port <= 5810 and source.ip:(10.0.0.0/8 or 172.16.0.0/12 or
