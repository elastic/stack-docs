[[breaking-6.0.0]]
==== Breaking Changes

Security::
* A new bootstrap check enforces that <<disabling-default-password, default passwords are disabled>> for the <<built-in-users, built-in users>>
  when running in {ref}/bootstrap-checks.html#_development_vs_production_mode[production mode].
  You must set `xpack.security.authc.accept_default_password` to `false` in your `elasticsearch.yml`
* A new configuration setting is available to <<disabling-default-password, disable support for the default password>> (_"changeme"_).

Watcher::
* The built-in HTTP client used in webhooks, the http input and the http email attachment has been replaced.
This results in the need to always escape all parts of an URL.
* The new built-in HTTP client also enforces a maximum request size, which defaults to 10mb.

[[bugs-6.0.0-alpha1]]
==== Bug Fixes

Watcher::
