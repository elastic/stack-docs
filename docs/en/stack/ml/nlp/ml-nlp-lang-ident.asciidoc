== {lang-ident-cap}

{lang-ident-cap} enables you to determine the language of text.

A {lang-ident} model is provided in your cluster, which you can use in an
{infer} processor of an ingest pipeline by using its model ID
(`lang_ident_model_1`). For an example, refer to <<ml-nlp-inference>>.

The longer the text passed into the {lang-ident} model, the more accurately the 
model can identify the language. It is fairly accurate on short samples (for 
example, 50 character-long streams) in certain languages, but languages that are 
similar to each other are harder to identify based on a short character stream.
If there is no valid text from which the identity can be inferred, the model
returns the special language code `zxx`. If you prefer to use a different
default value, you can adjust your ingest pipeline to replace `zxx` predictions
with your preferred value.

{lang-ident-cap} takes into account Unicode boundaries when the feature set is 
built. If the text has diacritical marks, then the model uses that information 
for identifying the language of the text. In certain cases, the model can 
detect the source language even if it is not written in the script that the 
language traditionally uses. These languages are marked in the supported 
languages table (see below) with the `Latn` subtag. {lang-ident-cap} supports 
Unicode input.

[[ml-lang-ident-supported-languages]]
=== Supported languages

The table below contains the ISO codes and the English names of the languages 
that {lang-ident} supports. If a language has a 2-letter `ISO 639-1` code, the 
table contains that identifier. Otherwise, the 3-letter `ISO 639-2` code is 
used. The `Latn` subtag indicates that the language is transliterated into Latin 
script.
