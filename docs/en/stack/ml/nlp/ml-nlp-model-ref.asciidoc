= Third party NLP models

:frontmatter-description: The list of compatible third party NLP models.
:frontmatter-tags-products: [ml] 
:frontmatter-tags-content-type: [reference] 
:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [analyze]

The {stack-ml-features} support transformer models that conform to the standard
BERT model interface and use the WordPiece tokenization algorithm.

The current list of supported architectures is:

* BERT
* DPR bi-encoders
* DistilBERT
* ELECTRA
* MobileBERT
* RetriBERT
* SentenceTransformers bi-encoders with the above transformer architectures

In general, any trained model that has a supported architecture is deployable in
{es} by using eland. However, it is not possible to test every third party
model. The following lists are therefore provided for informational purposes
only and may not be current. Elastic makes no warranty or assurance that the
{ml-features} will continue to interoperate with these third party models in the
way described, or at all.

These models are listed by NLP task; for more information about those tasks,
refer to <<ml-nlp-overview>>.
