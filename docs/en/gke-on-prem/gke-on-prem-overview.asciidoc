== Assumptions
It is assumed that you have an existing Elasticsearch and Kibana deployment in your data center and that there is network connectivity between your GKE On-Prem systems and both Elasticsearch and Kibana. 

== Overview of the Architecture

Within each of your GKE On-Prem Kubernetes clusters you will deploy DaemonSets containing Beats, the lightweight shippers for logs, metrics, network data, etc.  These Beats will autodiscover your applications and GKE On-Prem infrastructure by synchronizing with the Kubernetes API.  Your containers will be managed based on the process running in them; if you are running NGINX, then Filebeat will configure itself to collect NGINX logs and Metricbeat will configure itself to collect NGINX metrics.  These pre-packaged collections of configuration details are called "modules".  You can see the list of available modules in the documentation for Filebeat and Metricbeat.

A single Elasticsearch cluster with Kibana can be receiving, indexing, storing, and analyzing logs and metrics from multiple environments.  These environments might be:

. Servers, network devices, virtual machines, etc. in your data centers
. One or more GKE On-Prem environments in your data centers
. Other data sources
