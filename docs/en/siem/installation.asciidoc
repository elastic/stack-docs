== Get up and running

beta[]

To get up and running with security monitoring, you need:

* An Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana (version 6.x or later) with a basic
license. To learn how to get started quickly, see
{stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Getting started with the {stack}].

[TIP]
==============
You can skip installing {es} and {kib} by using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud. The {es} Service is available on both AWS and GCP.

Service for free].
==============

* {beats} shippers (version 6.x or later) installed on each system you want to
monitor

You might need to modify UI settings in {kib} to change default behaviors,
such as the index pattern used to query the data, and the timestamp field used
for sorting. For more information, see {kib}.
