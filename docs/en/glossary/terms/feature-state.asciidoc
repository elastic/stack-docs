[[glossary-feature-state]] feature state::
The indices and data streams used to store configurations, history, and other
data for an Elastic feature, such as {es} security or {kib}. A feature state
typically includes one or more <<glossary-system-index,system indices or data
streams>>. It may also include regular indices and data streams used by the
feature. You can use <<glossary-snapshot,snapshots>> to back up and restore
feature states. See {ref}/snapshot-restore.html#feature-state[feature states].
