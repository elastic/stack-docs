== {infra-ui} UI

beta[]

After you have infrastructure monitoring <<install-infrastructure-monitoring,up and running>>
and data is streaming to {es}, use the {infra-ui} UI in {kib} to monitor your
infrastructure and identify problems in real time.

For more information about working with the {infra-ui} UI, see the
{kibana-ref}/xpack-infra.html[{kib} documentation].

=== Monitor your hosts and containers

You start with an overview of the hosts and containers running in your
infrastructure. The overview provides a summary of high-level metrics, like CPU
usage, system load, memory usage, and network traffic, to help you assess the
overall health of your systems and services.

You can search for specific hosts to filter the overview, or enter
{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language] for more sophisticated
searches. To see data about related hosts or containers, you can group by important
characteristics, such as availability zones for cloud infrastructure, or
namespaces for containers.

When you see a potential problem, you can drill down into individual nodes to
view related metrics and logs.

=== View detailed metrics

After drilling down into the metrics for a specific node, you see details like
CPU usage, system load, memory usage, and network traffic over time. You can
place your cursor over a point in the timeline to see detailed metrics captured
at that moment in the timeline.
