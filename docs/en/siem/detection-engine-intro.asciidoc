= Detections (Beta)

beta[]

The SIEM Detections feature automatically searches for threats and creates 
signals when they are detected. Signal detection rules define the conditions 
for creating signals. Additionally, you can use the {kib}
{kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting and Actions]
framework to send notifications via other systems, such as email and Slack,
when signals are generated.

NOTE: To use {kib} Alerting for signal notifications, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

The {siem-app} comes with <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>> that search for
suspicious activity on your network and hosts. For information on how to
optimize the prebuilt rules, see <<tuning-detection-signals>>. You can also
<<rules-ui-create, create your own rules>>.

You can manage detection rules and signals via the UI or the
<<rule-api-overview, Detections API>>.

[IMPORTANT]
==============
To make sure you can access Detections and manage rules, see 
<<detections-permissions>>.

== Terminology

Rules::
Perform background tasks to detect suspicious activity. There are two types of
rules:

* Query-based rules search indices for documents that match their queries at
scheduled intervals. When a document matches, a signal is created.
* {ml-cap} rules create a signal when a {ml} job discovers an anomaly score
above a rule's defined threshold.

Signals::
Always refer to {siem-soln} produced detections. Signals are never received 
from external systems. When a rule's conditions are met, the {siem-app} 
writes one or more signals to an Elasticsearch `signals` index.
+
[NOTE]
==============
Signal indices are created for each {kib} space. The naming convention is:
`.siem-signals-<space name>`. For the default space, the signals index is named 
`.siem-signals-default`.
==============

Alerts and events::
Always refer to data the {siem-app} receives from external systems, such as 
Elastic Endpoint and Suricata.

Actions::
Used to send notifications via other systems when a signal is created, such as
email, Slack, PagerDuty, and Webhook.

[float]
== Signals and external alerts

The Detections page displays all signals and alerts. To view signals created 
by a rule, you can:

* Filter for a specific rule in the KQL bar (for example,
`signal.rule.name :"SSH (Secure Shell) from the Internet"`).
* View signals in the *Rule details* page (click
*Manage signal detection rules* -> rule name in the *All rules* table).

NOTE: KQL autocomplete for `.siem-signals-*` indices is available on the 
*Detections* and *Rule details* pages, and in Timeline when either `All events`
or `Signal events` is selected. 

To view alerts from external data shippers, click *External alerts*.

[float]
=== Open and close signals

You can close signals to indicate they do not need any further investigation. 
By default, the All signals table displays open signals. To view closed 
signals, click *Closed signals*.

To open and close signals, either:

* Click the *Close/Open signal* icon.
* Select the signals you want to open or close and then click 
*Close/Open selected*.

[[signals-to-timelines]]
=== Investigate signals in Timeline

To investigate a signal in Timeline, click the *Investigate in timeline*
icon.

If the rule that generated the signal uses a timeline template, when you
investigate the signal in Timeline, the following dropzone query values are
replaced with their corresponding signal values:

* `host.name`
* `host.hostname`
* `host.domain`
* `host.id`
* `host.ip`
* `client.ip`
* `destination.ip`
* `server.ip`
* `source.ip`
* `network.community_id`
* `user.name`
* `process.name`

*Example*

The timeline template used in the rule has this dropzone query:
`host.name: "Linux-LiverpoolFC"`. When signals generated by the rule are
investigated in Timeline, the `host.name` value is replaced with the signal's
`host.name` value. If the signal's `host.name` value is `Windows-ArsenalFC`,
the timeline dropzone query is `host.name: "Windows-ArsenalFC"`.

NOTE: For information on how to add timeline templates to rules, see
<<create-rule-ui>>.

[[detections-permissions]]
== Detections configuration and index privilege prerequisites

If you are using an *on-premises* {stack} deployment:

* HTTPS must be configured for communication between
{kibana-ref}/configuring-tls.html#configuring-tls-kib-es[{es} and {kib}].
* In the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file, set the 
`xpack.security.enabled` setting to `true`. For more information, see 
{ref}/settings.html[Configuring {es}] and
{ref}/security-settings.html[Security settings in {es}].
* In the `kibana.yml` {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configuration file], add the 
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` setting with any alphanumeric value 
of at least 32 characters. For example:
+
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: 'fhjskloppd678ehkdfdlliverpoolfcr'`

For *all* deployments (on-premises and hosted):

* To view signals and detection rules, you must have at least:
** `read` permissions for the `.siem-signals-<space name>` index, where
`<space name>` is the name of the {kib} space you are using to view Detections
(see {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges]).
** {kib} space `Read` privileges for the `SIEM` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
* To create and modify detection rules, you must have:
** {kib} space `All` privileges for the `SIEM` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
** Write permissions for the `.siem-signals-<space name>` index, such as 
`create` `create_doc`, `write`, `index`, and `all`
(see {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges]).

[float]
=== Resolve UI error messages

Depending on your privileges and whether a `.siem-signals-<space name>` index 
has already been created for the {kib} space, you might see an error message 
when you try to open the *Detections* page.

*`Letâ€™s set up your detection engine`*

If you see this message, a user with these privileges must visit the 
*Detections* page before you can view signals and rules:

* The `manage` cluster privilege (see {ref}/security-privileges.html[{es} security privileges]).
* The `create_index` index privilege (see {ref}/security-privileges.html[{es} security privileges]).
* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `SIEM` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).

NOTE: For *on-premises* {stack} deployments only, this message may be displayed 
when the
<<detections-permissions, `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`>> 
setting has not been added to the `kibana.yml` file.

*`Detection engine permissions required`*

If you see this message, you do not have the
<<detections-permissions, required privileges>> to view the *Detections* page, 
and you should contact your {kib} administrator.

NOTE: For *on-premises* {stack} deployments only, this message may be
displayed when the <<detections-permissions, `xpack.security.enabled`>>
setting is not enabled in the `elasticsearch.yml` file.
