[role="xpack"]
[[ml-<feature>]]
= <Feature>

////
(Required) The index page consists of a brief (one or two-sentence-long) 
description of the feature or functionality and a table of contents where the 
list items are links to the subpages. The goal of this page is to provide a 
summary of the chapter and guide the reader to the appropriate subsections.
////



[role="xpack"]
[[ml-<feature>-overview]]
== Overview

////
(Required) The conceptual overview summarizes the idea and machinery behind the 
feature and the main reasons why to use it. The aim of this summary is to inform 
the user about the main functions, to familiarize the domain language, basic 
terms, and to provide some context about the possible fields of usage (short 
examples, use cases).
////

[discrete]
[ml-<feature>-<title of subsection>]
=== <Title of the subsection>

////
The overview page may contain further subsections that thematize important 
concepts related to the feature, for example feature influence for outlier 
detection. If you want to refer to a concept (by using a link) elsewhere in the 
documentation, then it is considered important.
////



[role="xpack"]
[[ml-<feature>-concepts]]
== Concepts

////
(Optional) This section explains the fundamental concepts of the feature. It 
might be overlapping with the overview subsections (see below). A rule of thumb 
could be adding a Concepts section when there are more than two items that needs 
explanation longer than a couple of paragraphs. For example datafeeds or buckets 
in the anomaly detection documentation.
The Concepts main page consists of a TOC that links to the individual concept 
pages.

[role="xpack"]
[[ml-<feature>-configuration]]

== Configuring <feature>

////
(Optional) This page could be either a TOC of subpages that explain 
configuration topics or a single page that contains the explanation depending on 
the amount of content you want to add. This section contains minimal, getting 
started type configuration content. It may refer to more detailed configuration 
examples in the “Examples” section (if appropriate).
////

[role="xpack"]
[[ml-<feature>-configuration-<subtitle>]]

=== <Configuration subpage title>


<Configuration description. Use gerunds in the title to avoid the repetition of 
“How to…”, for example Configuring XYZ or Using ZYX.>



[role="xpack"]
[[ml-<feature>-api-quickref]]
== API quick reference

////
(Required) This page contains the base URL of the feature endpoint and the links 
to the API documentation.
////

All {ml} <feature> endpoints have the following base:

[source,js]
----
/_ml/

The main resources can be accessed with a variety of endpoints:

[role="xpack"]
[[<feature>-examples]]
== <Feature> examples

////
(Optional) The examples main page consists of a TOC with links to the respective sub-pages. 
The example sub-pages contain advanced examples for different configuration 
scenarios.

[[ml-<feature>-limitations]]
== <Feature> limitations

////
(Optional) List and description of known issues, limitations of the feature. It 
is a single page until such time as the number of limitations becomes large, 
then group them logically.
////

The following limitations and known problems apply to the {version} release of 
the Elastic <feature name>:

[[ml-<feature>-troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting <feature>

////
(Optional) A high-level overview of common problems and provides guidance on how 
to avoid/workaround frequently experienced issues. It is a single page until 
such time as the number of items becomes large, then group them logically.
