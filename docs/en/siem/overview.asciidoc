== Overview

beta[]

{siem-soln} gives you a comprehensive view into your security operations,
and helps make those insights actionable.

The {siem-app} in {kib} brings together data from a variety of sources, making it easier
for you to identify and resolve security issues.

[[siem-components]]
=== SIEM components

SIEM requires the following {stack} components.

image::images/siem-architecture.png[]

*https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[{beats}]* are open source data
shippers that you install as agents on your servers to send operational data to
{es}. 

*https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[{es}]* is a real-time,
distributed storage, search, and analytics engine. {es} excels is indexing
streams of semi-structured data, such as logs or metrics.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[{kib}]* is an open source analytics and
visualization platform designed to work with {es}. You use {kib} to search,
view, and interact with data stored in {es} indices. You can easily perform
advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables,
and maps.

{kib} {siem-ui} provides a dedicated user interface for visualizing host security.

[[data-sources]]
=== Data sources

SIEM can collect and normalize data from a variety of sources using Beats and
Beats modules. {beats} and {beats} modules use the {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]
to normalize data from various data sources.

*Hosts data sources*

* Auditbeat
** System module  - Linux, macOS, Win
*** packages
*** processes
*** logins
*** sockets
*** users and groups
** Auditd module (Linux Kernel Audit info)
** File integrity module (FIM) - Linux, macOS, Win
* Filebeat 
** system logs (auth logs) - Linux
** Santa - macOS
* Winlogbeat
** Windows event logs - Windows


*Network data sources*

* Packetbeat
** Flows
** DNS
** other protocols
* Filebeat
** Zeek NMS module
** Suricata IDS module
** Iptables/Ubiquiti module
** CoreDNS module
** Envoy proxy module (Kubernetes)
** Palo Alto firewall module*
** Cisco ASA firewall module*


[[ecs]]
==== Elastic Common Schema (ECS) for normalizing data

The {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)] defines a common set of fields to be used for
storing event data in Elasticsearch. ECS helps users normalize their event data
to better analyze, visualize, and correlate the data represented in their
events. 

{siem-soln} can collect and normalize events from ECS-compatible data sources.
Data from custom or third-party sources and tagged `host.name` can be included.
