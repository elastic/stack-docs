= Detections (Beta)

beta[]

The SIEM Detections feature automatically searches for threats and creates 
signals when they are detected. Signal detection rules define the conditions 
for creating signals. The {siem-app} comes with
<<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>> that search for suspicious 
activity on your network and hosts. Additionally, you can
<<rules-ui-create, create your own rules>>.

You can manage detection rules and signals via the UI or the
<<rule-api-overview, Detections API>>.

[IMPORTANT]
==============
To make sure you can access Detections and manage rules: 

* For *local {kib} deployments only*, <<detections-encryption-key, add the `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` setting to the `kibana.yml` configuration file>>.
* Check you have the <<detections-permissions, {kib} and index privileges>> 
required for viewing signals and creating rules.

== Terminology

Signals::
Always refer to {siem-soln} produced detections. Signals are never received 
from third-party systems. When a rule's conditions are met, the {siem-app} 
writes one or more signals to an Elasticsearch `signals` index.

[NOTE]
==============
Signal indices are created for each {kib} space. The naming convention is:
`.siem-signals-<space name>`. For the default space, the signals index is named 
`.siem-signals-default`.
==============

Alerts and events::
Always refer to data the {siem-app} receives from external systems, such as 
Elastic Endpoint and Suricata.

[float]
== Signals and external alerts

The Detections page displays all signals and alerts. To view signals created 
by a rule, you can:

* Filter for a specific rule in the KQL bar (for example,
`signal.rule.name :"SSH (Secure Shell) from the Internet"`).
* View signals in the *Rule details* page (click
*Manage signal detection rules* -> rule name in the *All rules* table).

NOTE: KQL autocomplete for `.siem-signals-*` indices is available on the 
*Detections* and *Rule details* pages, and in timelines where `All events` or 
`Signal events` are selected. 

To view alerts from external data shippers, click *External alerts*.

[float]
=== Open and close signals

You can close signals to indicate they do not need any further investigation. 
By default, the All signals table displays open signals. To view closed 
signals, click *Closed signals*.

To open and close signals, either:

* Click the *Close/Open signal* icon.
* Select the signals you want to open or close and then click 
*Close/Open selected*.

[float]
=== Send signals to the Timeline

To investigate a signal in the Timeline, click the *View in timeline* icon.

[[detections-encryption-key]]
== Add the `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` setting

NOTE: This is only required when using a local {kib} deployment. If you are 
using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service], you do 
not need to add this setting.

By default, each time {kib} starts a new encryption key is generated for 
{kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html[saved objects]. Signal detection rules 
are based on saved objects and, without a persistent key, you cannot delete or 
modify existing rules after restarting {kib}.

To set a persistent key, add the `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` 
setting with any alphanumeric value of at least 32 characters to the 
`kibana.yml` {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configuration file]. For example:

`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: 'fhjskhsdhd678ehkdfdlliverpoolfcr'`

[float]
[[detections-permissions]]
== {kib} and index privileges required for Detections

Depending on your privileges and whether a `.siem-signals-<space name>` index 
has been created for the {kib} space, you might see an error message when you 
try to open the *Detections* page.

[float]
=== `Letâ€™s set up your detection engine` message

If you see this message, a user with these privileges must open the *Detections*
page before you can view signals and rules:

* The `manage_api_key` cluster privilege (see
{ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges]).
* The `create_index` privilege for the {kib} space (see {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges]).
* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `SIEM` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).

[float]
=== `Detection engine permissions required` message

If you see this message, you do not have the required privileges to view the 
*Detections* page and you should contact your {kib} administrator.

[NOTE]
==============
If you are using a local {es} deployment, make sure the 
`xpack.security.enabled` setting in the `elasticsearch.yml` 
configuration file is set to `true`. For more information, see 
{ref}/settings.html[Configuring {es}] and
{ref}/security-settings.html[Security settings in {es}].
==============

To view signals and detection rules, you must have at least:

* `read` permissions for the `.siem-signals-<space name>` index, where
`<space name>` is the name of the {kib} space you are using to view Detections
(see {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges]).
* {kib} space `Read` privileges for the `SIEM` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).

To create and modify detection rules, you must have:

* The `manage_api_key` cluster privilege (see {ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges]).
* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `SIEM` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
* Write permissions for the `.siem-signals-<space name>` index, such as 
`create` `create_doc`, `write`, `index`, and `all`
(see {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges]).
