== Managing signal detection rules

beta[]

Rules run periodically and search the specified indices for 
documents that meet their criteria.

[IMPORTANT]
==============
After you activate a rule, periodically check the rule is running as expected. 
When a rule fails to run, the {siem-app} tries to rerun it at its next 
scheduled run time and an error is displayed in the *Failure History* table on 
the *Rule details* page (*SIEM* -> *Detections* ->
*Manage signal detection rules* -> <rule name>).

If you see a 
`gaps of <x> minutes, and could be missing signals within that time` error 
message, see <<troubleshoot-signals>>.
==============

On the Rules page, you can:

* <<load-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<select-all-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<create-rule-ui, Create your own rules>>
* <<manage-rules-ui, Clone, edit, delete, activate, and deactivate rules>>
* <<import-export-rules-ui>>
* <<troubleshoot-signals>>

[[load-prebuilt-rules]]
=== Load prebuilt Elastic rules

To load the {siem-app}'s <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>, click
*Load Elastic prebuilt rules* on the *Signal detection rules* page (*SIEM* -> 
*Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*).

If you delete any of the prebuilt rules, a button appears that enables 
reloading all the deleted prebuilt rules.

[NOTE]
==============
By default, prebuilt rules are not activated. If you want to modify a prebuilt 
rule, you must first duplicate it and then make your changes to the duplicated 
rule. <<filter-rule-process>> provides a detailed example of duplicating and modifying a rule.

All Elastic prebuilt rules are tagged with the word `Elastic`.
==============

[float]
[[select-all-prebuilt-rules]]
=== Select and duplicate all prebuilt rules

. Select the *Elastic rules* tab.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
. Click the `Rows per page` menu, and then select _200 rows_.
. When the page reloads, select all the rules.
. Click _Bulk actions_ -> _Duplicate selected_.
. Select the *Custom rules* tab.

You can then modify the duplicated rules and, if required, delete the prebuilt 
ones.

[float]
[[create-rule-ui]]
=== Create a new rule

You can create two types of rules:

* *Custom query*: Query-based rule, which searches the defined indices and creates a signal when a document matches the rule's query.
* *Machine learning*: {ml-cap} rule, which creates a signal when a {ml} job discovers an anomaly above the defined threshold (see <<machine-learning>>).

IMPORTANT: You can only create {ml} jobs when you have a
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Platinum License] or you are using a
{ess-trial}[Cloud] deployment.

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*.
. Click *Create new rule*.
+
The *Create new rule* page is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/create-new-rule.png[]
. Do *one* of the following:
* To create a rule based on a {ml} anomaly threshold, select _Machine Learning_
and then:
.. The required {ml} job.
.. The anomaly score threshold above which signals are created.
* To create a rule base on a KQL or Lucene query, select _Custom query_ and
then:
.. Define which {es} indices the rule analyzes for signals.
.. Use the filter and query fields to create the criteria used for detecting 
signals.
+
NOTE: You can use {kib} saved queries (save icon) and queries from saved timelines (`Import query from saved timeline`) as rule conditions.
+
For example, the following rule detects when the `vssadmin delete shadows`
Windows command is executed:

** _Index patterns_: `winlogbeat-*`
+
Winlogbeat ships Windows event logs to the SIEM app.
** _Custom query_: `event.action:"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)" and process.name:"vssadmin.exe" and process.args:("delete" and "shadows")`
+
Searches the `winlogbeat-*` indices for `vssadmin.exe` executions with 
the `delete` and `shadow` arguments, used to delete a volume's shadow copies.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::rule-query-example.png[]
+
TIP: This example is based on the
<<volume-shadow-copy-deletion-via-vssadmin, Volume Shadow Copy Deletion via VssAdmin>> prebuilt rule.

. Select the timeline template used when you  send a signal
created by the rule to the timeline (optional).
+
TIP: Before you create rules, create and save relevant
<<timelines-ui,timelines>> so they can be selected here. 

. Click *Continue*.
+
The *About rule* pane is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/about-rule-pane.png[]
. Fill in the following fields:
.. _Name_: The rule's name.
.. _Description_: A description of what the rule does.
.. _Severity_: Select the severity levels of signals created by the rule:
* `Low`: Signals that are of interest but generally not considered to be 
security incidents. Sometimes, a combination of low severity events can 
indicate suspicious activity.
* `Medium`: Signals that require investigation.
* `High`: Signals that require an immediate investigation.
* `Critical`: Signals that indicate it is highly likely a security incident has 
 occurred.
.. _Risk score_: A numerical value between 0 and 100 that correlates with the _Severity_ level. General guidelines are:
* `0` - `21` represents low severity.
* `22` - `47` represents medium severity.
* `48` - `73` represents high severity.
* `74` - `100` represents critical severity.
.. For additional options, click *Advanced settings* and fill in any of 
these fields:
... _Reference URLs_ (optional): References to information that is relevant to 
the rule. For example, links to relevant background information.
... _False positives_ (optional): List of common scenarios that may produce 
false-positive signals.
... _MITRE ATT&CK^TM^_ (optional): Relevant MITRE framework tactics and techniques.
... _Tags_ (optional): Words and phrases used to categorize, filter, and search 
the rule.
... _Investigation guide_ (optional): Information for analysts investigating
signals created by the rule.
. Click *Continue*.
+
[[rule-schedule]]
The *Schedule rule* pane is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/schedule-rule.png[]
. Select how often the rule runs.
. Optionally, add `Additional look-back time` to the rule. When defined, the 
rule searches indices with the additional time.
+
For example, if you set a rule to run every 5 minutes with an additional
look-back time of 1 minute, the rule runs every 5 minutes but analyses the 
documents added to indices during the last 6 minutes.
+
[IMPORTANT]
==============
It is recommended to set the `Additional look-back time` to at 
least 1 minute. This ensures there are no missing signals when a rule does not 
run exactly at its scheduled time.

The {siem-app} performs deduplication. Duplicate signals discovered during the 
`Additional look-back time` are *not* created.
==============
. Click *Continue*.
+
[[rule-actions]]
The *Rule actions* pane is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-actions.png[]
. Select the action frequency (how often actions are triggered when signals
are generated (optional):

* _On each rule execution_: Performs actions every time signals are generated.
* _Hourly_: Performs actions every hour when signals are created within that
time frame.
* _Daily_: Performs actions every day when signals are created within that
time frame.
* _Weekly_: Performs actions every week when signals are created within that
time frame.
+
The available action types are displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/available-action-types.png[]

. Select the required action types.
+
IMPORTANT: Each action type requires its own connector. Connectors store the
information required to trigger the action in the external system. You can
configure connectors while creating the rule or on the {kib} Alerts and Actions
page (*Management* -> *Alerts and Actions* -> *Connectors*). For more
information, see {kibana-ref}/action-types.html[Action and connector types].

+
For each action type, you can add these place holders in the message body: 

. Save the rule with or without activation.
+
NOTE: When you activate a rule, it is queued and its schedule is determined by 
its initial run time. For example, if you activate a rule that runs every 5 
minutes at 14:03 but it does not run until 14:04, it will run again at 14:09.

[float]
[[manage-rules-ui]]
=== Modify existing rules

You can clone, edit, activate, deactivate, and delete rules:

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*.
. Do one of the following:
* Click the actions icon (three dots) and then select the required action.
* In the *Rule* column, select all the rules you want to act on, and then the 
required action from the `Batch actions` menu.
. To activate or deactivate a rule, click the Activate toggle button.

NOTE: For prebuilt rules, you can only edit the <<rule-actions, rule action>>
settings.

[float]
[[import-export-rules-ui]]
=== Import and export rules

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*.
. To import rules:
.. Click *Import rule*.
.. Drag-and-drop files containing the signal detection rules.
+
NOTE: Imported rules must be in a `ndjson` file.

. To export rules:
.. In the *All rules* table, select the rules you want to export.
.. Select *Batch actions* -> *Export selected*.
+
NOTE: You cannot export prebuilt rules.

[float]
[[troubleshoot-signals]]
=== Troubleshoot missing signals

When a rule fails to run close to its scheduled time, some signals may be 
missing. There are a number of steps you can perform to try and resolve this 
issue.

If you are seeing `gaps of <x> minutes` error messages for a small number of 
rules, you can increase those rules' `Additional look-back time`
(*Signal detection rules* page -> the rule's actions icon ->
*Edit rule settings* -> *Schedule* -> _Additional look-back time_).

If you are seeing `gaps of <x> minutes` for a lot of rules:

* If you restarted {kib} when many rules were activated, try deactivating them 
and then reactivating them in small batches at staggered intervals. This 
ensures {kib} does not attempt to run all the rules at the same time.
* Consider adding another {kib} instance to your environment.
