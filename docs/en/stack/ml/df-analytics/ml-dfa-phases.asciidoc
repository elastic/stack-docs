= How a {dfanalytics-job} works

A {dfanalytics-job} is essentially a persistent {es} task. During its life 
cycle, it goes through four or five main phases depending on the analysis type:

* reindexing,
* loading data,
* analyzing,
* writing results,
* inference ({regression} and {classification} only).

Let's take a look at the phases one-by-one.

[[ml-dfa-phases-reindex]]
== Reindexing

During the reindexing phase the documents from the source index or indices are 
copied to the destination index. If you want to define settings or mappings, 
create the index before you start the job. Otherwise, the job creates it using 
default settings.

Once the destination index is built, the {dfanalytics-job} task calls the {es} 
{ref}/docs-reindex.html[Reindex API] to launch the reindexing task.

[[ml-dfa-phases-load]]
== Loading data

After the reindexing is finished, the job fetches the needed data from the 
destination index. It converts the data into the format that the analysis 
process expects, then sends it to the analysis process.

[[ml-dfa-phases-analyze]]
== Analyzing

In this phase, the job generates a {ml} model for analyzing the data. The 
specific phases of analysis vary depending on the type of {dfanalytics-job}.

{oldetection-cap} jobs have a single analysis phase called `computing_outliers`, 
in which they identify outliers in the data.

{regression-cap} and {classification} jobs have four analysis phases:

. `feature_selection`: Identifies which of the supplied fields are most relevant 
  for predicting the dependent variable. 
. `coarse_parameter_search`: Identifies initial values for undefined 
  hyperparameters.
. `fine_tuning_parameters`: Identifies final values for undefined 
  hyperparameters. See <<hyperparameters,hyperparameter optimization>>.
. `final_training`: Trains the {ml} model.

[[ml-dfa-phases-write]]
== Writing results

After the loaded data is analyzed, the analysis process sends back the results. 
Only the additional fields that the analysis calculated are written back, the 
ones that have been loaded in the loading data phase are not. The 
{dfanalytics-job} matches the results with the data rows in the destination 
index, merges them, and indexes them back to the destination index. When the 
process is complete in case of an {oldetection} job, the task is marked as 
completed and the {dfanalytics-job} stops. Your data is ready to be evaluated.

[[ml-dfa-phases-inference]]
== {infer-cap}

This phase exists only for {regression} and {classification} jobs. In this 
phase, the job infers the test split of the data set agains the trained model. 
When the process is complete, the task is marked as completed and the 
{dfanalytics-job} stops. Your data is ready to be evaluated.
