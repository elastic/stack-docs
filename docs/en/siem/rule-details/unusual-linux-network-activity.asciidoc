=== Unusual Linux Network Activity

Identifies Linux processes that do not usually use the network but have
unexpected network activity, which can indicate command-and-control, lateral
movement, persistence, or data exfiltration activity. A process with unusual
network activity can denote process exploitation or injection, where the process
is used to run persistence mechanisms that allow a malicious actor remote access
or control of the host, data exfiltration, and execution of unauthorized network
applications.

==== Potential false positives

A newly installed program or one that rarely uses the network could trigger this
signal.

==== Investigation guide

Signals from this rule indicate the presence of network activity from a Linux
process for which network activity is rare and unusual.  Here are some possible
avenues of investigation:

* Consider the IP addresses and ports. Are these used by normal but infrequent
network workflows? Are they expected or unexpected?
* If the destination IP address is remote or external, does it associate with
an expected domain, organization or geography?
+
NOTE: Avoid interacting directly with suspected malicious IP addresses. 

* Consider the user as identified by the username field. Is this network
activity part of an expected workflow for the user who ran the program?
* Examine the history of execution. If this process manifested only
very recently, it might be part of a new software package. If it has a
consistent schedule - for example if it runs monthly or quarterly - it might be
part of a monthly or quarterly business or maintenance process.
* Examine the process arguments, title and working directory. These may provide
indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is
performing.
