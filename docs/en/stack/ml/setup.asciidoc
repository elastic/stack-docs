To use the {stack} {ml-features}, you must have the
{subscriptions}[appropriate subscription] and at least one
<<ml-nodes,{ml} node>> in your cluster.

In {kib}, the {ml-features} must be visible in your
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-feature-visibility[space] and your 
source index patterns must exist in the same space as your {ml} jobs.

If {stack} {security-features} are enabled, you must also ensure your users have
the <<setup-privileges,necessary privileges>>.

TIP: The fastest way to get started with {ml-features} is to
{ess-trial}[start a free 14-day trial of {ess}] in the cloud.

[[ml-nodes]]
== Machine learning nodes

To use {ml-features}, there must be at least one {ml} node in your cluster. A
{ml} node is a node that has `xpack.ml.enabled` set to `true` and `ml` in
`node.roles`.

If nodes do not have the {ml} role, they cannot run {ml} jobs. If
`xpack.ml.enabled` is `true`, however, they can service API requests. For more
information, see {ref}/modules-node.html#ml-node[Machine learning nodes].

[discrete]
[[setup-privileges]]
== Security privileges

The {stack-security-features} provide roles and privileges that make it easier
to control which users can manage or view {ml} objects such as jobs, {dfeeds},
results, and model snapshots. {kib} also enables you to control access to the
{ml-features} within each space. For more information, see {ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges] and
{kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[{kib} privileges].

For full access to the {ml-features} in {kib}, you must have:

[%interactive]
* [ ] `all` {kib} privileges for the {ml-features} in the appropriate spaces
* [ ] `read` and `view_index_metadata` index privileges on source indices
* [ ] `read`, `manage`, and `index` index privileges on destination indices (for
  {dfanalytics-jobs} only)
  
For read-only access to the {ml-features} in {kib}, you must have:

[%interactive]
* [ ] `read` {kib} privileges for the {ml-features} in the appropriate spaces
* [ ] `read` index privileges on source indices
* [ ] `read` index privileges on destination indices (for {dfanalytics-jobs}
only)

To upload files in {kib} with the *{file-data-viz}*, you must have:

[%interactive]
* [ ] `all` {kib} privileges for the {ml-features} in the appropriate spaces.
Alternatively, `read` {kib} privileges for the {ml-features} and `all` {kib}
privileges for the index pattern management feature
* [ ] `ingest_admin` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role]
* [ ] `read`, `manage`, and `index` index privileges for destination indices

IMPORTANT: You cannot limit access to specific {ml} objects in each space. If
the {ml} feature is visible in your space and you have `read` or `all` {kib}
privileges for the feature, you have access to *all* {ml} objects in that space.

If you call {ml} APIs directly, you must have the index privileges listed above
as well as `machine_learning_admin` or `machine_learning_user` built-in roles.

WARNING: The `machine_learning_admin` and `machine_learning_user` roles grant
access to the {ml-features} in all {kib} spaces. Therefore, when you use {kib}, 
use custom roles instead and set your {kib} privileges appropriately for each
space.
