. The {ml-features} also use the concept of a bucket to divide the time series
into batches for processing. The _bucket span_ is part of the configuration
information for {anomaly-jobs}. It defines the time interval that is used to
summarize and model the data. This is typically between 5 minutes to 1 hour and
it depends on your data characteristics. When you set the bucket span, take into
account the granularity at which you want to analyze, the frequency of the input
data, the typical duration of the anomalies, and the frequency at which alerting
is required.
