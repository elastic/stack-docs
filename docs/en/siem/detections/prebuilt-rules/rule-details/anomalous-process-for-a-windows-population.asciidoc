=== Anomalous Process For a Windows Population

Searches for rare processes running on multiple hosts in an entire fleet or
network. This reduces the detection of false positives since automated
maintenance processes usually only run occasionally on a single machine but are
common to all or many hosts in a fleet.

==== Potential false positives

A newly installed program or one that runs rarely as part of a monthly or
quarterly workflow could trigger this signal.

==== Investigation guide

Signals from this rule indicate the presence of a Windows process that is rare
and unusual for all of the Windows hosts for which Winlogbeat data is
available. Here are some possible avenues of investigation:

* Consider the user as identified by the username field. Is this program part
of an expected workflow for the user who ran this program on this host?
* Examine the history of execution. If this process manifested only very
recently, it might be part of a new software package. If it has a consistent
schedule - for example if it runs monthly or quarterly - it might be part of a monthly or quarterly business process.
* Examine the process metadata like the values of the Company, Description and
Product fields, which may indicate whether the program is associated with an
expected software vendor or package.
* Examine arguments and working directory. These may provide
indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is
performing.
* Consider the same for the parent process. If the parent process is
a legitimate system utility or service, this could be related to software
updates or system management. If the parent process is something user-facing
like an Office application, this process could be more suspicious.
* If you have file hash values in the event data, and you suspect malware, you
can optionally run a search for the file hash to see if the file is identified
as malware by anti-malware tools.
