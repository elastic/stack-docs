==== Potential false positives

Netcat is a dual-use tool that can be used for benign or malicious activity.
Netcat is included in some Linux distributions so its presence is not
necessarily suspicious. Some normal use of this program, while uncommon, may
originate from scripts, automation tools, and frameworks.
