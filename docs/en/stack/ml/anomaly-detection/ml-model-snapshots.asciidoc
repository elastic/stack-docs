== Model snapshots

As described in <<ml-analyzing>>, {stack} {ml-features} can calculate baselines
of normal behavior then extrapolate anomalous events. These baselines are
accomplished by generating models of your data. 

To ensure resilience in the event of a system failure, snapshots of the {ml}
model for each {anomaly-job} are saved to an internal index within the {es}
cluster. By default, snapshots are captured approximately every 3 to 4 hours and 
retained for one day (twenty-four hours). The amount of time necessary to
save these snapshots is proportional to the size of the model in memory.

You can use the {ref}/ml-update-job.html[update {anomaly-jobs} API] to change
the interval (`background_persist_interval`) and retention
(`model_snapshot_retention_days`) of these snapshots.

There are also situations where you might want to
{ref}/ml-revert-snapshot.html[revert] to using a specific model snapshot. The
{ml-features} react quickly to anomalous input and new behaviors in data. Highly 
anomalous input increases the variance in the models and {ml} analytics must 
determine whether it is a new step-change in behavior or a one-off event. In the
case where you know this anomalous input is a one-off, it might be appropriate
to reset the model state to a time before this event. For example, you might
consider reverting to a saved snapshot after Black Friday or a critical system 
failure. If you know about such events in advance, you can use
<<ml-calendars,calendars and scheduled events>> to avoid impacting your model.
