= Create NLP inference pipelines
:keywords: {ml-init}, {stack}, {nlp}, inference 

After you <<ml-nlp-deploy-models,deploy a trained model in your cluster>>, you
can use it to perform {nlp} tasks in ingest pipelines. 

. Verify that all of the
{ref}/ingest.html#ingest-prerequisites[ingest pipeline prerequisites] are met.
. In {kib}, create a new pipeline in **Stack Management** > **Ingest Pipelines**.

.. Click **Create pipeline**.
.. Provide a name and description for the pipeline.
.. Add an {ref}/inference-processor.html[inference processor] to your pipeline:
... Click **Add a processor** and select the **Inference** processor type.
... Set **Model ID** to the name of your trained model, for example
`elastic__distilbert-base-cased-finetuned-conll03-english`.
... Click **Add** to save the processor.
.. Optional: Add a set processor to index the ingest timestamp.
... Click **Add a processor** and select the **Set** processor type.
... Choose a name for the field (such as `timestamp`) and set its value to
`{{{_ingest.timestamp}}}`. For more details, refer to
{ref}/ingest.html#access-ingest-metadata[Access ingest metadata in a processor].
... Click **Add** to save the processor.
.. To test the pipeline, click **Add documents**.
... In the **Documents** tab, provide a sample document for testing. For example,
to test a trained model that performs named entity recognition (NER):
+
[source,js]
----
[
  {
    "_source": {
    "text_field":"Hello, my name is Josh and I live in Berlin."
    }
  }
]
----
// NOTCONSOLE
... Click **Run the pipeline** and verify the pipeline worked as expected.
... If everything looks correct, close the panel, and then click **Create
pipeline**. The pipeline is now ready for use.
. Optional: Create a new index with explicit mappings. For example, use the
create index API in the **Dev Tools** > **Console**:
+
--
[source,console]
----
PUT ner-test
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "ml.inference.predicted_value": {"type": "annotated_text"},
      "ml.inference.model_id": {"type": "keyword"},
      "text_field": {"type": "text"},
      "timestamp": {"type": "date"}
    }
  }
}
----
TIP: The `annotated_text` data type in this example is included in the
{plugins}/mapper-annotated-text.html[mapper annotated text plugin]. For more
installation details, refer to   
{cloud}/ec-adding-elastic-plugins.html[Add plugins provided with {ess}].
--
. Use the new pipeline to index some documents. For example, use a bulk
indexing request with the `pipeline` query parameter:
+
--
[source,console]
----
POST /_bulk?pipeline=ner
{"create":{"_index":"ner-test","_id":"1"}}
{"text_field":"Hello, my name is Josh and I live in Berlin."}
{"create":{"_index":"ner-test","_id":"2"}}
{"text_field":"I work for Elastic which was founded in Amsterdam."}
{"create":{"_index":"ner-test","_id":"3"}}
{"text_field":"Elastic has headquarters in Mountain View, California."}
{"create":{"_index":"ner-test","_id":"4"}}
{"text_field":"Elastic's founder, Shay Banon, created Elasticsearch to solve a simple need: finding recipes!"}
{"create":{"_index":"ner-test","_id":"5"}}
{"text_field":"Elasticsearch is built using Lucene, an open source search library."}
----

TIP: You can also use NLP pipelines when you are reindexing documents to a new
destination. Refer to
{ref}/docs-reindex.html#reindex-with-an-ingest-pipeline[Reindex with an ingest pipeline].
--
. Verify the results in **Discover**:
+

image::images/ml-nlp-discover-ner.png[An expanded view of predicted values in the Discover app,align="center"]

The
`ml.inference.predicted_value` field contains the output from the inference
processor. In this example, two documents were found to contain the `Elastic`
organization entity.  

NOTE: When you view the index for the first time in {kib}, you must
{kibana-ref}/data-views.html[create a data view].
