= Configure {anomaly-detect}

Before you can use the {stack-ml-features}, there are some configuration
requirements (such as security privileges) that must be addressed. Refer to
<<setup>>.

To use the {ml-features} to analyze your data, you can create an {anomaly-job}
and send your data to that job.

The results of {ml} analysis are stored in {es} and you can use {kib} to help
you visualize and explore the results.

//For a tutorial that walks you through these configuration steps,
//see <<ml-getting-started>>.

* <<stopping-ml>>
* <<ml-restart-failed-jobs>>

After you learn how to create and stop {anomaly-detect} jobs, you can check the 
<<anomaly-examples>> for more advanced settings and scenarios.

Consult <<anomaly-detection-scale>> to learn more about the particularities of 
large {anomaly-jobs}.
