= Detection Engine

//Ben: placeholder
The detection engine automatically searches for threats and creates signals 
when they are detected. These threats are detected using rules that define the 
conditions required for a signal to be issued. The {siem-app} comes 
preconfigured rules that search for suspicious activity on your network and 
hosts. Additionally, you can <<rules-ui-create, create your own rules>> to meet your specific needs.

== Terminology

To ensure all terms are well-defined:

Signals::
Alway refer to a {siem-soln} produced detection. That is, signals are never 
received from third-party systems. When a detection engine rule's conditions 
are met, the {siem-app} writes one or more signals to an Elasticsearch 
`signals` index.

Alerts and events::
Always refer to data and detections {siem-soln} receives from data shippers and 
third-party tools, such as {beats} and Elastic Endpoint Security.
