=== Tor Activity to the Internet

Detects network events that may indicate the use of Tor traffic to the Internet.
Tor is a network protocol that sends traffic through a series of encrypted
tunnels used to conceal a user's location and usage. Tor may be used by threat
actors as an alternate communication pathway to conceal the actor's identity and
avoid detection.

==== Potential false positives

Tor client activity is uncommon in managed enterprise networks but may be common
in unmanaged or public networks where few security policies apply. Because these
ports are in the ephemeral range, this rule may false under certain conditions
such as when a NATed web server replies to a client which has used one of these
ports by coincidence. In this case, such servers can be excluded if desired.
