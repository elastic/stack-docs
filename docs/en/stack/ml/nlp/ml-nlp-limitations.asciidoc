== ELSER v1 semantic search is limited to 512 tokens per field that inference is applied to

When you use ELSER v1 for semantic search, only the first 512 extracted tokens 
from each field of the ingested documents that ELSER is applied to are taken 
into account for the search process. If your data set contains long documents, 
divide them into smaller segments before ingestion for an optimal search 
performance.
