== Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning

For *Free Trial*, *https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup[Cloud]*
and *https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Platinum License]* deployments,
{kibana-ref}/xpack-ml.html[Machine Learning] functionality is available throughout the SIEM app. You can
view the details of detected anomalies within the `Anomalies` table widget
shown on the Hosts, Network and associated Details pages, or even narrow to
the specific date range of an anomaly from the `Max Anomaly Score` details in
the overview of the Host and IP Details pages. Each of these interfaces also
offer the ability to drag and drop details of the anomaly to Timeline, such
as the `Entity` itself, or any of the associated `Influencers`.

=== Manage machine learning jobs
For users with the `ml_admin` role, the `Anomaly Detection` interface within
the main navigation header can be used for for viewing, starting, and stopping
SIEM machine learning jobs.

TIP: To add a custom job to the `Anomaly Detection` interface, add a `SIEM` tag to
the job's `Group` field ({kib} -> {ml-cap} -> Create/Edit job -> Job details).

==== Prebuilt Jobs

The SIEM app ships with prebuilt Machine Learning Jobs for detecting anomalies.
If you ship data using https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[Beats] and your environment
is configured with the appropriate indices (`auditbeat-*`, `filebeat-*`, `packetbeat-*`,
or `winlogbeat-*`) via {kib} -> Management -> Index Patterns, the jobs will be installed
on page load, and will be displayed within the `Anomaly Detection` interface.

NOTE: Machine learning jobs look back and analyse two weeks of historical data prior to
the time they are enabled. After jobs are enabled, they continuously analyse incoming data.
When jobs are stopped and restarted within the two week timeframe, previously
analysed data is not processed again.

The following prebuilt jobs are available:
[horizontal]
rare_process_by_host_windows_ecs::
+
rare_process_by_host_linux_ecs:: Identifies rare processes that do not usually run
on individual Windows/Linux hosts, which can indicate execution of unauthorized
services, malware, or persistence mechanisms.
+
Processes are considered rare when they only run occasionally as compared with
other processes running on the host.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Auditbeat (Linux)
* Winlogbeat (Windows)
windows_anomalous_network_activity_ecs::
+
linux_anomalous_network_activity_ecs:: Identifies Windows/Linux processes that do
not usually use the network but have unexpected network activity, which could indicate
command-and-control, lateral movement, persistence, or data exfiltration activity.
+
A process with unusual network activity can denote process exploitation or injection,
where the process is used to run persistence mechanisms that allow a malicious actor
remote access or control of the host, data exfiltration, and execution of unauthorized
network applications.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Auditbeat (Linux)
* Winlogbeat (Windows)
windows_anomalous_path_activity_ecs:: Identifies processes started from atypical
folders in the file system, which might indicate malware execution or persistence
mechanisms.
+
In corporate Windows environments, software installation is centrally managed and
it is unusual for programs to be executed from user or temporary directories.
Processes executed from these locations can denote that a user downloaded software
directly from the internet or a malicious script/macro executed malware.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Winlogbeat
windows_anomalous_process_all_hosts_ecs::
+
linux_anomalous_process_all_hosts_ecs:: Searches for rare processes running on
multiple Windows/Linux hosts in an entire fleet or network.
+
This reduces the detection of false positives since automated maintenance processes
often only occasionally run on a single machine but are common to all or many hosts
in a fleet.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Auditbeat (Linux)
* Winlogbeat (Windows)
windows_anomalous_process_creation:: Identifies unusual parent/child process
relationships that could indicate malware execution or persistence mechanisms.
+
Malicious scripts often call on other applications and processes as part of their
exploit payload. For example, when a malicious Office document runs scripts as
part of an exploit payload, Excel or Word may start a script interpreter process,
which, in turn, runs a script that downloads and executes malware. Another common
scenario is Outlook running an unusual process when malware is downloaded in an email.
+
Monitoring and identifying anomalous process relationships is an excellent way of detecting
new and emerging malware that is not yet recognized by anti-virus scanners.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Winlogbeat
windows_anomalous_script:: Searches for PowerShell scripts with unusual data
characteristics, such as obfuscation, that may be a characteristic of malicious
PowerShell script text blocks.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Winlogbeat
windows_anomalous_service:: Searches for unusual Windows services that could indicate
execution of unauthorized services, malware, or persistence mechanisms.
+
In corporate Windows environments, hosts do not generally run many rare or unique
services. This job helps detect malware and persistence mechanisms that have been
installed and run as a service.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Winlogbeat
windows_anomalous_user_name_ecs::
+
linux_anomalous_user_name_ecs:: Searches for activity from users who are not normally
active, which could indicate unauthorized changes, activity by unauthorized users,
lateral movement, and compromised credentials.
+
In organizations, new usernames are not often created apart from specific types of
system activities, such as creating new accounts for new employees. These user
accounts quickly become active and routine.
+
Events from rarely used usernames can point to suspicious activity. Additionally,
automated Linux fleets tent to see activity from rarely used usernames only when
personnel log in to make authorized or unauthorized changes, or threat actors have
acquired credentials and log in for malicious purposes. Unusual usernames can also
indicate pivoting, where compromised credentials are used to try and move
laterally from one host to another.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Auditbeat (Linux)
* Winlogbeat (Windows)
linux_anomalous_network_port_activity_ecs:: Identifies unusual destination port
activity that could indicate command-and-control, persistence mechanism, or data
exfiltration activity.
+
Rarely used destination port activity is generally unusual in Linux fleets and can
indicate unauthorized access or threat actor activity.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Auditbeat
linux_anomalous_network_service:: Searches for unusual listening ports that
could indicate execution of unauthorized services, backdoors, or persistence mechanisms.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Auditbeat
linux_anomalous_network_url_activity_ecs:: Searches for unusual web URL requests
from hosts, which could indicate malware delivery and execution.
+
Wget and cURL are commonly used by Linux programs to download code and data. Most
of the time, their usage is entirely normal. Generally, because they use a list of
URLs, they repeatedly download from the same locations. However, Wget and cURL are
sometimes used to deliver Linux exploit payloads, and threat actors use these tools
to download additional software and code. For these reasons, unusual URLs can
indicate unauthorized downloads or threat activity.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Auditbeat
suspicious_login_activity_ecs:: Identifies an unusually high number of authentication
attempts.
+
Beats required on hosts:

* Auditbeat (Windows and Linux)
* Winlogbeat (Windows)

[[view-anomolies]]
=== View detected anomalies
To view the `Anomalies` table widget and `Max Anomaly Score By Job` details,
the user must have the `ml_admin` or `ml_user` role.

NOTE: To adjust the `score` threshold for which {xpack-ref}/xpack-ml.html[anomalies]
are shown, you can modify {kib} -> Management -> Advanced Settings -> `siem:defaultAnomalyScore`.
