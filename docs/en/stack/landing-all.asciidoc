Search. Observe. Protect.

Search is foundational to a wide variety of experiences — from finding documents to monitoring infrastructure to protecting against security threats. Elastic is a search company that powers three solutions built on one powerful stack: the {stack}. Deploy them anywhere (from the cloud to bare metal) to instantly find actionable insights from any type of data.
