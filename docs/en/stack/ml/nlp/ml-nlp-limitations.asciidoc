== ELSER semantic search is limited to 512 tokens per field that inference is applied to

When you use ELSER for semantic search, only the first 512 extracted tokens from 
each field of the ingested documents that ELSER is applied to are taken into 
account for the search process. If your data set contains long documents, divide 
them into smaller segments before ingestion if you need the full text to be 
searchable.
