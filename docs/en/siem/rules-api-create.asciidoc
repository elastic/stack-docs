Creates a new signal detection rule.

==== Request URL

`POST /api/detection_engine/rules`

==== Request body

A JSON object with these fields:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Name |Type |Description |Required

|description |String |The rule's description. |Yes

|enabled |Boolean |Determines whether the rule is enabled. |No, defaults to
`true`.

|false_positives |String[] |String array used to describe common reasons why 
the rule may issue false-positive signals. |No, defaults to an empty array.

// |filter |Object |{kibana-ref}/field-filter.html[Filter] used by the rule to 
// create a signal |Yes, for filter-based rules only

|filters |Object[] |The {ref}/query-filter-context.html[query and filter 
context] array used to define the conditions for when signals are created from 
events. |No, defaults to an empty array.

[[detection-rules-from]]
|from |String |Time from which data is analyzed each time the rule executes,
using a {ref}/common-options.html#date-math[date math range]. For example, 
`now-4200s` means the rule analyzes data from 70 minutes before its start 
time. |No, defaults to `now-6m` (analyzes data from 6 minutes before the start 
time).

|rule_id |String |Unique ID used to identify rules. For example, when a rule 
is converted from a third-party security solution. |No, automatically created 
when it is not provided.

|index |String[] |Indices on which the rule functions. |No, defaults to the 
{siem-soln} indices defined on the {kib} Advanced Setting page (*Kibana* → 
*Management* → *Advanced Settings* → `siem:defaultIndex`).

|interval |String |Frequency of rule execution, using a
{ref}/common-options.html#date-math[date math range]. For example, `"1h"` 
means the rule runs every hour. |No, defaults to `5m` (5 minutes).

|query |String |{kibana-ref}/search.html[Query] used by the rule to create a 
signal. |No, defaults to an empty string.

|language |String |Determines the query language, which must be
`kuery` or `lucene`. |No, defaults to `kuery`.

|output_index |String |Index to which signals detected by the rule are saved. 
|No, if unspecified signals are saved to `.siem-signals-<space_name>` index, 
where `<space_name>` is the name of the {kib} space in which the rule exists.

|saved_id |String |Kibana saved search used by the rule to create signals.
|Yes, for `saved_query` rules only.

|meta |Object |Placeholder for metadata about the rule. | No

|risk_score |Integer a|A numerical representation of the signal's severity from 
0 to 100, where:

* `0` - `21` represents low severity
* `22` - `47` represents medium severity
* `48` - `73` represents high severity
* `74` - `100` represents critical severity

|Yes

|max_signals |Integer |Maximum number of signals the rule can create during a
single execution. |No, defaults to `100`.

|name |String |The rule's name. |Yes

|severity |String a|Severity level of signals produced by the rule, which must 
be one of the following:

* `low`: Signals that are of interest but generally not considered to be 
security incidents
* `medium`: Signals that require investigation
* `high`: Signals that require immediate investigation
* `critical`: Signals that indicate it is highly likely a security incident has 
occurred

|Yes

|tags |String[] |String array containing words and phrases to help categorize,
filter, and search rules. |No, defaults to an empty array.

// |to |String |Time to which data is analyzed each time the rule executes, using a
// {ref}/common-options.html#date-math[date math range]. For example, `"now-300s"` 
// means the rule analyzes data until 5 minutes before its starts time. |Yes

|type |String a|Data type on which the rule is based:

* `query`: query-based conditions with or without additional filters
* `saved_query`: saved search, identified in the `saved_id` field

|Yes


|threat |<<threats-object-create, threat[]>> |Object containing attack 
information about the type of threat the rule monitors, see
{ecs-ref}/ecs-threat.html[ECS threat fields]. |No, defaults to an empty array.

|references |String[] |String array containing notes about or references to 
relevant information about the rule. |No, defaults to an empty array.

|version |Integer |The rule's version number. a|No, defaults to `1`.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Name |Type |Description |Required

<1> The rule runs every hour.
<2> When the rule runs it analyzes data from 70 minutes before its start time.

*Example*

If the rule starts to run at 15:00, it analyzes data from 13:50 until 15:00. 
When it runs next, at 16:00, it will analyze data from 14:50 until 16:00.

==== Response code

`200`:: 
    Indicates a successful call.
    
==== Response payload

A JSON object that includes a unique ID, the time the rule was created, and its version number. If the request payload did not include a `rule_id` field, a unique rule ID is also generated.
