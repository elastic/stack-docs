=== SSH (Secure Shell) from the Internet

Detects network events that may indicate the use of SSH traffic from
the Internet. SSH is commonly used by system administrators to remotely control
a system using the command line shell. If it is exposed to the Internet, it
should be done with strong security controls as it is frequently targeted and
exploited by threat actors as an initial access or back-door vector.

==== Potential false positives

Some network security policies allow SSH directly from the Internet but usage
that is unfamiliar to server or network owners can be unexpected and
suspicious. SSH services may be exposed directly to the Internet in some
networks such as cloud environments. In such cases, only SSH gateways,
bastions or jump servers may be expected expose SSH directly to the Internet
and can be exempted from this rule. SSH may be required by some workflows
such as remote access and support for specialized software products and servers.
Such workflows are usually known and not unexpected.
