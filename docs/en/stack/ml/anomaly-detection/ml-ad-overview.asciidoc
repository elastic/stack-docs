:description: An introduction to {ml} {anomaly-detect}, which analyzes time \
series data to identify and predict anomalous patterns in your data.

Use {anomaly-detect} to analyze time series data by creating accurate baselines 
of normal behavior and identifying anomalous patterns in your dataset. Data is 
pulled from {es} for analysis and anomaly results are displayed in {kib} 
dashboards. Consult <<setup>> to learn more about the licence and the security 
privileges that are required to use {anomaly-detect}.

[[ml-analyzing]]
== Analyzing the past and present

The {ml-features} automate the analysis of time series data by creating
accurate baselines of normal behavior in the data and identifying anomalous
patterns in that data. You can submit your data for analysis in batches or
continuously in real-time {dfeeds}.

Using <<anomaly-algorithms,proprietary {ml} algorithms>>, the following
circumstances are detected, scored, and linked with statistically significant
influencers in the data:

* Anomalies related to temporal deviations in values, counts, or frequencies
* Statistical rarity
* Unusual behaviors for a member of a population

Automated periodicity detection and quick adaptation to changing data ensure
that you don’t need to specify algorithms, models, or other data science-related
configurations in order to get the benefits of {ml}.

You can view the {ml} results in {kib} where, for example, charts illustrate the
actual data values, the bounds for the expected values, and the anomalies that
occur outside these bounds.

[[ml-forecasting]]
== Forecasting the future

After the {ml-features} create baselines of normal behavior for your data,
you can use that information to extrapolate future behavior.

You can use a forecast to estimate a time series value at a specific future date.
For example, you might want to determine how many users you can expect to visit
your website next Sunday at 0900.

You can also use it to estimate the probability of a time series value occurring
at a future date. For example, you might want to determine how likely it is that
your disk utilization will reach 100% before the end of next week.

Each forecast has a unique ID, which you can use to distinguish between forecasts
that you created at different times. You can create a forecast by using the
{ref}/ml-forecast.html[forecast {anomaly-jobs} API] or by using {kib}. For
example:

The yellow line in the chart represents the predicted data values. The
shaded yellow area represents the bounds for the predicted values, which also
gives an indication of the confidence of the predictions.

When you create a forecast, you specify its _duration_, which indicates how far
the forecast extends beyond the last record that was processed. By default, the
duration is 1 day. Typically the farther into the future that you forecast, the
lower the confidence levels become (that is to say, the bounds increase).
Eventually if the confidence levels are too low, the forecast stops.
For more information about limitations that affect your ability to create a
forecast, see <<ml-forecast-config-limitations>>.

You can also optionally specify when the forecast expires. By default, it
expires in 14 days and is deleted automatically thereafter. You can specify a
different expiration period by using the `expires_in` parameter in the
{ref}/ml-forecast.html[forecast {anomaly-jobs} API].

[[anomaly-algorithms]]
== {anomaly-detect-cap} algorithms

The {anomaly-detect} {ml-features} use a bespoke amalgamation of different
techniques such as clustering, various types of time series decomposition,
Bayesian distribution modeling, and correlation analysis. These analytics
provide sophisticated real-time automated {anomaly-detect} for time series data.

The {ml} analytics statistically model the time-based characteristics of your
data by observing historical behavior and adapting to new data. The model
represents a baseline of normal behavior and can therefore be used to determine
how anomalous new events are.

{anomaly-detect-cap} results are written for each <<ml-buckets,bucket span>>.
These results include scores that are aggregated in order to reduce noise and
normalized in order to rank the most mathematically significant anomalies. For
more information, see <<ml-bucket-results>> and <<ml-influencer-results>>.
