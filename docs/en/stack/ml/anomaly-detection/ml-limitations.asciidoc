<titleabbrev>Limitations</titleabbrev>
++++

The following limitations and known problems apply to the {version} release of 
the Elastic {ml-features}. The limitations are grouped into four categories:

* <<ad-platform-limitations>> are related to the platform that hosts the {ml} 
  feature of the {stack}.
* <<ad-config-limitations>> apply to the configuration process of the 
  {anomaly-jobs}.
* <<ad-operational-limitations>> affect the behavior of the {anomaly-jobs} that 
  are running.
* <<ad-ui-limitations>> only apply to {anomaly-jobs} managed via the user 
  interface.

== Platform limitations

[[ml-limitations-sse]]
=== CPUs must support SSE4.2

{ml-cap} uses Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) 4.2 instructions, so it works only
on machines whose CPUs 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#Supporting_CPUs[support] SSE4.2. If you run 
{es} on older hardware you must disable {ml} by setting `xpack.ml.enabled` to 
`false`. See {ref}/ml-settings.html[{ml-cap} settings in {es}].


[discrete]
[[ml-scheduling-priority]]
=== CPU scheduling improvements apply to Linux and MacOS only

When there are many {ml} jobs running at the same time and there are 
insufficient CPU resources, the JVM performance must be prioritized so search 
and indexing latency remain acceptable. To that end, when CPU is constrained on 
Linux and MacOS environments, the CPU scheduling priority of native analysis 
processes is reduced to favor the {es} JVM. This improvement does not apply to 
Windows environments.


[discrete]
[[ad-config-limitations]]
== Configuration limitations


[discrete]
=== Terms aggregation size affects data analysis
//See x-pack-elasticsearch/#601

By default, the `terms` aggregation returns the buckets for the top ten terms.
You can change this default behavior by setting the `size` parameter.

If you send pre-aggregated data to a job for analysis, you must ensure that the 
`size` is configured correctly. Otherwise, some data might not be analyzed.


[discrete]
=== Fields named "by", "count", or "over" cannot be used to split data
//See x-pack-elasticsearch/#858

You cannot use the following field names in the `by_field_name` or
`over_field_name` properties in a job: `by`; `count`; `over`. This limitation
also applies to those properties when you create advanced jobs in {kib}.


[discrete]
=== Rollup indices and index patterns are not supported

Rollup indices and index patterns cannot be used in machine learning jobs or 
{dfeeds}. This limitation applies irrespective of whether you create the jobs in 
{kib} or by using APIs. In {kib}, if you select an index, saved search, or index 
pattern that uses the Rollup feature, the {ml} job creation wizards fail. 

See {ref}/xpack-rollup.html[Rolling up historical data].


[discrete]
[[ml-frozen-limitations]]
=== Frozen indices are not supported

{ref}/frozen-indices.html[Frozen indices] cannot be used in {anomaly-jobs} or 
{dfeeds}. This limitation applies irrespective of whether you create the jobs in 
{kib} or by using APIs. This limitation exists because it's currently not
possible to specify the `ignore_throttled` query parameter for search requests
in {dfeeds} or jobs. See
{ref}/searching_a_frozen_index.html[Searching a frozen index].


[discrete]
[[ml-forecast-config-limitations]]
=== Unsupported forecast configurations

There are some limitations that affect your ability to create a forecast:

* You can generate only three forecasts per {anomaly-job} concurrently. There is 
no limit to the number of forecasts that you retain. Existing forecasts are not 
overwritten when you create new forecasts. Rather, they are automatically 
deleted when they expire.
* If you use an `over_field_name` property in your {anomaly-job} (that is to 
say, it's a _population job_), you cannot create a forecast.
* If you use any of the following analytical functions in your {anomaly-job},
you cannot create a forecast:
** `lat_long`
** `rare` and `freq_rare`
** `time_of_day` and `time_of_week`

=== Categorization uses English dictionary words
//See x-pack-elasticsearch/#3021
Categorization identifies static parts of unstructured logs and groups similar
messages together. The default categorization tokenizer assumes English language
log messages. For other languages you must define a different
`categorization_analyzer` for your job. For more information, see
<<ml-configuring-categories>>.

Additionally, a dictionary used to influence the categorization process contains
only English words. This means categorization might work better in English than
in other languages. The ability to customize the dictionary will be added in a
future release.


[discrete]
=== Post data API requires JSON format

The post data API enables you to send data to a job for analysis. The data that
you send to the job must use the JSON format.

For more information about this API, see
{ref}/ml-post-data.html[Post Data to Jobs].


[discrete]
=== Misleading high missing field counts
//See x-pack-elasticsearch/#684

One of the counts associated with a {ml} job is `missing_field_count`,
which indicates the number of records that are missing a configured field.
//This information is most useful when your job analyzes CSV data. In this case,
//missing fields indicate data is not being analyzed and you might receive poor results.

Since jobs analyze JSON data, the `missing_field_count` might be misleading.
Missing fields might be expected due to the structure of the data and therefore
do not generate poor results.

For more information about `missing_field_count`,
see the {ref}/ml-get-job-stats.html[get {anomaly-job} statistics API].


[discrete]
=== Security integration

When the {es} {security-features} are enabled, a {dfeed} stores the roles of the 
user who created or updated the {dfeed} **at that time**. This means that if the 
roles the user has are changed after they create or update a {dfeed} then the 
{dfeed} continues to run without change. However, if instead the permissions 
associated with the roles that are stored with the {dfeed} are changed then this 
affects the {dfeed}. For more information, see <<ml-datafeeds>>.


[discrete]
[[ml-result-size-limitations]]
=== Job and {dfeed} APIs have a maximum search size
//https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34864

In 6.6 and later releases, the {ref}/ml-get-job.html[get jobs API] and the
{ref}/ml-get-job-stats.html[get job statistics API] return a maximum of 10,000
jobs. Likewise, the {ref}/ml-get-datafeed.html[get {dfeeds} API] and the
{ref}/ml-get-datafeed-stats.html[get {dfeed} statistics API] return a maximum of
10,000 {dfeeds}.


[discrete]
[[ml-forecast-limitations]]
=== Forecast operational limitations

There are some factors that may be considered when you run forecasts:

* Forecasts run concurrently with real-time {ml} analysis. That is to say, {ml}
analysis does not stop while forecasts are generated. Forecasts can have an
impact on {anomaly-jobs}, however, especially in terms of memory usage. For this
reason, forecasts run only if the model memory status is acceptable.
* The {anomaly-job} must be open when you create a forecast. Otherwise, an error
occurs.
* If there is insufficient data to generate any meaningful predictions, an
error occurs. In general, forecasts that are created early in the learning phase
of the data analysis are less accurate.

[[ad-ui-limitations]]
== Limitations in {kib}


[discrete]
=== Pop-ups must be enabled in browsers
//See x-pack-elasticsearch/#844

The {ml-features} in {kib} use pop-ups. You must configure your web browser so 
that it does not block pop-up windows or create an exception for your {kib} URL.


[discrete]
=== Anomaly Explorer and Single Metric Viewer omissions and limitations
//See x-pack-elasticsearch/#844 and x-pack-kibana/#1461

In {kib}, **Anomaly Explorer** and **Single Metric Viewer** charts are not 
displayed for anomalies that were due to categorization (if model plot is not 
enabled), `time_of_day` functions, `time_of_week` functions, or `lat_long` 
geographic functions.

If model plot is not enabled, the charts are not displayed for detectors that 
use script fields either (except for scripts that define metric fields). In that 
case, the original source data cannot be easily searched because it has been 
transformed by the script.

If your <<aggs-dfeeds,{dfeed} uses aggregations with nested `terms` aggs>> and 
model plot is not enabled for the {anomaly-job}, neither the **Anomaly 
Explorer** nor the **Single Metric Viewer** can plot and display an anomaly 
chart for the job. In these cases, the charts are not visible and an explanatory 
message is shown.

The charts can also look odd in circumstances where there is very little data to 
plot. For example, if there is only one data point, it is represented as a 
single dot. If there are only two data points, they are joined by a line.


[discrete]
=== Jobs created in {kib} must use {dfeeds}

If you create jobs in {kib}, you must use {dfeeds}. If the data that you want to
analyze is not stored in {es}, you cannot use {dfeeds} and therefore you cannot
create your jobs in {kib}. You can, however, use the {ml} APIs to create jobs
and to send batches of data directly to the jobs. For more information, see
<<ml-datafeeds>> and <<ml-api-quickref>>.


[discrete]
=== Jobs created in {kib} use model plot config and pre-aggregated data
//See x-pack-elasticsearch/#844

If you create single or multi-metric jobs in {kib}, it might enable some
options under the covers that you'd want to reconsider for large or
long-running jobs.

For example, when you create a single metric job in {kib}, it generally
enables the `model_plot_config` advanced configuration option. That 
configuration option causes model information to be stored along with the 
results and provides a more detailed view into {anomaly-detect}. It is 
specifically used by the **Single Metric Viewer** in {kib}. When this option is 
enabled, however, it can add considerable overhead to the performance of the 
system. If you have jobs with many entities, for example data from tens of 
thousands of servers, storing this additional model information for every bucket 
might be problematic. If you are not certain that you need this option or if you 
experience performance issues, edit your job configuration to disable this 
option.

Likewise, when you create a single or multi-metric job in {kib}, in some cases
it uses aggregations on the data that it retrieves from {es}. One of the
benefits of summarizing data this way is that {es} automatically distributes
these calculations across your cluster. This summarized data is then fed into
{ml} instead of raw results, which reduces the volume of data that must
be considered while detecting anomalies. However, if you have two jobs, one of
which uses pre-aggregated data and another that does not, their results might
differ. This difference is due to the difference in precision of the input data.
The {ml} analytics are designed to be aggregation-aware and the likely increase
in performance that is gained by pre-aggregating the data makes the potentially
poorer precision worthwhile. If you want to view or change the aggregations
that are used in your job, refer to the `aggregations` property in your {dfeed}. 

When the aggregation interval of the {dfeed} and the bucket span of the job 
don't match, the values of the chart plotted in both the **Single Metric 
Viewer** and the **Anomaly Explorer** differ from the actual values of the job. 
To avoid this behavior, make sure that the aggregation interval in the {dfeed} 
configuration and the bucket span in the {anomaly-job} configuration have the 
same values.

[[ml-space-limitations]]
=== {ml-cap} objects do not belong to {kib} spaces

If you create {kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[spaces] in {kib}, you see only the  
saved objects that belong to that space. This limited scope does not apply to 
{ml} objects; they are visible in all of your spaces.  

However, the {kib} {ml-features} interact with some saved objects (such as 
index patterns, dashboards, and visualizations) that might not be available in 
all spaces. For example:

* experimental[] If you upload a file on the *Machine Learning* page in {kib}, 
the {ml-features} identify the file format and field mappings. You can then 
optionally import that data into an {es} index and create an index pattern. This 
index pattern belongs to the space that is active when you import the file. If 
you want to use the index pattern in other spaces, you must create it as needed.  
* Likewise, if you use the single-metric, multi-metric, or population job 
wizards to create a job in {kib}, you can encounter problems if you subsequently 
try to clone the job in a different space. In particular, problems occur when 
you try to clone the job in a space that does not contain appropriate index 
patterns. 
* If you used a supplied configuration to create jobs (for example, for Apache 
or NGINX web access logs), visualizations and dashboards are automatically 
generated. These objects belong to the space that was active when you created 
the job. If you change your active space, custom URLs from the {ml} results to 
the dashboards or visualizations might fail.

=== Jobs close on the {dfeed} end date
//See x-pack-elasticsearch/#1037

If you start a {dfeed} and specify an end date, it will close the job when
the {dfeed} stops. This behavior avoids having numerous open one-time jobs.

If you do not specify an end date when you start a {dfeed}, the job
remains open when you stop the {dfeed}. This behavior avoids the overhead
of closing and re-opening large jobs when there are pauses in the {dfeed}.
