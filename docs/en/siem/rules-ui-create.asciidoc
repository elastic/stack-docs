=== Managing signal detection rules

beta[]

Rules run periodically and search the specified indices for 
documents that meet their criteria.

IMPORTANT: If a rule fails to run, the {siem-app} tries to 
rerun it at its next scheduled run time and an error is displayed in the 
*Failure History* table on the *Rule details* page (*SIEM* -> *Detections* ->
*Manage signal detection rules* -> <rule name>).

On the Rules page, you can:

* <<load-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<select-all-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<create-rule-ui, Create your own rules>>
* <<manage-rules-ui, Clone, delete, activate, and deactivate rules>>
* <<import-export-rules-ui>>

[[load-prebuilt-rules]]
==== Load prebuilt Elastic rules

To load the {siem-app}'s <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>, click
*Load Elastic prebuilt rules* on the *Signal detection rules* page (*SIEM* -> 
*Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*).

If you delete any of the prebuilt rules, a button appears that enables 
reloading all the deleted prebuilt rules.

[NOTE]
==============
By default, prebuilt rules are not activated. If you want to modify a prebuilt 
rule, you must first duplicate it and then make your changes to the duplicated 
rule.

All Elastic prebuilt rules are tagged with the word `Elastic`.
==============

[[select-all-prebuilt-rules]]
==== Select and duplicate all prebuilt rules

. Select the *Elastic rules* tab.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
. Click the `Rows per page` menu, and then select _200 rows_.
. When the page reloads, select all the rules.
. Click _Bulk actions_ -> _Duplicate selected_.
. Select the *Custom rules* tab.

You can then modify the duplicated rules and, if required, delete the prebuilt 
ones.

[[create-rule-ui]]
==== Create a new rule

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*.
. Click *Create new rule*.
+
The *Create new rule* page is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::create-new-rule.png[]
. Define which {es} indices the rule analyzes for signals.
. Use the filter and query fields to create the criteria used for detecting 
signals.
+
NOTE: You can use {kib} saved queries (save icon) and queries from saved timelines (`Import query from saved timeline`) as rule conditions.
+
For example, the following rule detects when the `vssadmin delete shadows`
Windows command is executed:

* _Index patterns_: `winlogbeat-*`
+
Winlogbeat ships Windows event logs to the SIEM app.
* _Custom query_: `event.action:"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)" and process.name:"vssadmin.exe" and process.args:("delete" and "shadows")`
+
Searches the `winlogbeat-*` indices for `vssadmin.exe` executions with 
the `delete` and `shadow` arguments, used to delete a volume's shadow copies.

. Click *Continue*.
+
The *About rule* pane is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::about-rule-pane.png[]
. Fill in the following fields:
.. _Name_: The rule's name.
.. _Description_: A description of what the rule does.
.. _Severity_: Select the severity levels of signals created by the rule:
* `Low`: Signals that are of interest but generally not considered to be 
security incidents. Sometimes, a combination of low severity events can 
indicate suspicious activity.
* `Medium`: Signals that require investigation.
* `High`: Signals that require an immediate investigation.
* `Critical`: Signals that indicate it is highly likely a security incident has 
 occurred.
.. _Risk score_: A numerical value between 0 and 100 that correlates with the _Severity_ level. General guidelines are:
* `0` - `21` represents low severity.
* `22` - `47` represents medium severity.
* `48` - `73` represents high severity.
* `74` - `100` represents critical severity.
.. For additional options, click *Advanced settings* and fill in any of 
these fields: 
... _Timeline template_ (optional): Select a timeline template used when you 
send a signal created by the rule to the timeline.
+
TIP: Before you create rules, create and save relevant
<<timelines-ui,timelines>> so they can be selected here. 

... _Reference URLs_ (optional): References to information that is relevant to 
the rule. For example, links to relevant background information.
... _False positives_ (optional): List of common scenarios that may produce 
false-positive signals.
... _MITRE ATT&CK^TM^_ (optional): Relevant MITRE framework tactics and techniques.
... _Tags_ (optional): Words and phrases used to categorize, filter, and search 
the rule.
. Click *Continue*.
+
The *Schedule rule* pane is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]

. Select how often the rule runs.
. Optionally, add `Additional look-back time` to the rule. When defined, the 
rule searches indices with the additional time.
+
For example, if you set a rule to run every 5 minutes with an additional
look-back time of 1 minute, the rule runs every 5 minutes but analyses the 
documents added to indices during the last 6 minutes.
+
[IMPORTANT]
==============
It is recommended to set the `Additional look-back time` to at 
least 1 minute. This ensures there are no missing signals when a rule does not 
run exactly at its scheduled time.

The {siem-app} performs deduplication. Duplicate signals discovered during the 
`Additional look-back time` are *not* created.
==============
. Save the rule with or without activation.
+
NOTE: When you activate a rule, it is queued and its schedule is determined by 
its initial run time. For example, if you activate a rule that runs every 5 
minutes at 14:03 but it does not run until 14:04, it will run again at 14:09.

[[manage-rules-ui]]
==== Modify existing rules

You can clone, edit, activate, deactivate, and delete rules:

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*.
. Do one of the following:
* Click the actions icon (three dots) and then select the required action.
* In the *Rule* column, select all the rules you want to act on, and then the 
required action from the `Batch actions` menu.
. To activate or deactivate a rule, click the Activate toggle button.

[[import-export-rules-ui]]
==== Import and export rules

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*.
. To import rules:
.. Click *Import rule*.
.. Drag-and-drop files containing the signal detection rules.
+
NOTE: Imported rules must be in a `ndjson` file.

. To export rules:
.. In the *All rules* table, select the rules you want to export.
.. Select *Batch actions* -> *Export selected*.
+
NOTE: You cannot export prebuilt rules.
