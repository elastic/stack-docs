== Monitoring Elasticsearch

By default, {xpack} monitoring agents on Elasticsearch index data
into the cluster where they're running. In production, you should
send data to a separate monitoring cluster so that historical monitoring
data is available even if the nodes you are monitoring are not. Using
a dedicated monitoring cluster also enables you to monitor multiple
clusters from a central location.

To store monitoring data in a separate cluster:

. Set up the Elasticsearch cluster you want to use for monitoring,
<<installing-xpack, install {xpack}>>, and start Elasticsearch. For
example, you might set up a two host cluster with the nodes `es-mon-1`
and `es-mon-2`.
+
NOTE: To monitor an Elasticsearch 5.x cluster, you must run Elasticsearch
5.x on the monitoring cluster. While installing {xpack} on the monitoring
cluster is not absolutely required, it is strongly recommended.

. Install X-Pack into Kibana.
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------
bin/kibana-plugin install x-pack
----------------------------------------------------------

. Configure Kibana to retrieve data from your monitoring cluster
by setting the `elasticsearch.url` property in `kibana.yml` to point
to the monitoring cluster.
+
[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.url: "http://es-mon-1:9200"
----------------------------------------------------------

. If {security} is enabled on the monitoring cluster:

.. Configure the `server.ssl` properties to encrypt communications
between the browser and the Kibana server.
+
[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------
server.ssl.key: /path/to/your/server.key
server.ssl.cert: /path/to/your/server.crt
----------------------------------------------------------

.. If SSL/TLS is enabled on the monitoring cluster, specify the trusted
CA certificate(s) that will be used to verify the identity of the nodes
in the monitoring cluster.
+
[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.ssl.ca: "/path/to/ca/file"
----------------------------------------------------------
+
For more information about configuring Kibana to connect to a secured
cluster, see <<kibana, Kibana and Security>>.

.. Create a user on the monitoring cluster that has the
`remote_monitoring_agent` role. These credentials will be used when
data is shipped from the Elasticsearch cluster you are monitoring to
your dedicated monitoring cluster. For example, the following request
creates a `remote_monitor` user that has the `remote_monitoring_agent` role:
+
--
[source, sh]
---------------------------------------------------------------
POST /_xpack/security/user/remote_monitor
{
  "password" : "changeme",
  "roles" : [ "remote_monitoring_agent"],
  "full_name" : "Internal Agent For Remote Monitoring"
}
---------------------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
--

. Start Kibana by running `bin/kibana`.

. Install {xpack} on the Elasticsearch nodes in your production cluster.
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------
bin/elasticsearch-plugin install x-pack
----------------------------------------------------------

. Configure each Elasticsearch node in the cluster you are
monitoring to send metrics to your monitoring cluster by
configuring an HTTP exporter in the
`xpack.monitoring.exporters` settings in `elasticsearch.yml`.
+
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.exporters:
  id1:
    type: http
    host: ["http://es-mon-1:9200", "http://es-mon2:9200"] <1>
    auth.username: remote_monitor <2>
    auth.password: changeme
--------------------------------------------------
<1> If SSL/TLS is enabled on the monitoring cluster, you must
connect through HTTPS.
<2> If {security} is disabled on the monitoring cluster, you can
omit `auth.username` and `auth.password`.

. If SSL/TLS is enabled on the monitoring cluster, specify the trusted
CA certificate(s) that will be used to verify the identity of the nodes
in the monitoring cluster.
+
To add a CA certificate to an Elasticsearch node's trusted certificates, you
can specify the location of the PEM encoded certificate with the
`certificate_authorities` setting:
+
--
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.exporters:
  id1:
    type: http
    host: ["https://es-mon1:9200", "https://es-mon2:9200"]
    auth:
      username: agent-user
      password: password
    ssl:
      certificate_authorities: [ "/path/to/ca.crt" ]
  id2:
    type: local
--------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can configure trusted certificates using a truststore
(a Java Keystore file that contains the certificates):

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.exporters:
  id1:
    type: http
    host: ["https://es-mon1:9200", "https://es-mon2:9200"]
    auth:
      username: remote_monitor
      password: changeme
    ssl:
      truststore.path: /path/to/file
      truststore.password: password
  id2:
    type: local
--------------------------------------------------

--

. Restart Elasticsearch on the nodes in your production cluster.
+
TIP: You may want to temporarily {ref}/modules-cluster.html[disable shard
allocation] before you restart your nodes to avoid unnecessary shard
reallocation during the install process.

. To verify your {monitoring} installation, point your web browser at your Kibana
host, and select **Monitoring** from the side navigation. When security is enabled,
to view the monitoring dashboards you must log in to Kibana as a user who has
both the `kibana_user` and `monitoring_user` roles. For example:
+
--
[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /_xpack/security/user/stack-monitor
{
  "password" : "changeme",
  "roles" : [ "kibana_user", "monitoring_user" ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

=== Collecting Data from Particular Indices
By default, the monitoring agent collects data from all Elasticsearch indices.
To collect data from particular indices, configure the
`xpack.monitoring.collection.indices` setting in `elasticsearch.yml`.
You can specify multiple indices as a comma-separated list or
use an index pattern to match multiple indices:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.collection.indices: logstash-*, index1, test2
----------------------------------

You can prepend `+` or `-` to explicitly include or exclude index
names or patterns. For example, to include all indices that
start with `test` except `test3`, you could specify `+test*,-test3`.

[float]
[[http-exporter-reference]]
=== HTTP Exporter

When you configure
an exporter in `elasticsearch.yml`, the default `local` exporter is disabled.

The `http` exporter uses the low-level Elasticsearch REST Client. This allows
the `http` exporter to send its data to any Elasticsearch cluster it can access
through the network.

The `http` exporter supports a number of settings that control how it
communicates over HTTP to remote clusters. In most cases, it is not
necessary to explicitly configure these settings. For detailed
descriptions, see <<http-exporter-settings, Monitoring Settings>>.

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.exporters:
  my_local: <1>
    type: local
  my_remote: <2>
    type: http
    host: [ "10.1.2.3", ... ] <3>
    auth: <4>
      username: my_username
      password: changeme
    connection:
      timeout: 6s
      read_timeout: 60s
    ssl: ... <5>
    proxy:
      base_path: /some/base/path <6>
    headers: <7>
      My-Proxy-Header: abc123
      My-Other-Thing: [ def456, ... ]
    index.name.time_format: YYYY-MM <8>

----------------------------------
<1> A `local` exporter defined explicitly whose arbitrary name is `my_local`.
<2> An `http` exporter defined whose arbitrary name is `my_remote`.
<3> `host` is a required setting for `http` exporters, which can take a few
    different forms as described in the table below.
<4> User authentication for those using X-Pack Security or some other
    form of user authentication protecting the cluster.
<5> See below for all TLS / SSL settings. If not supplied, the default
    node-level TLS / SSL settings will be used.
<6> Optional base path to prefix any outgoing request with in order to
    work with proxies.
<7> Arbitrary key/value pairs to define as headers to send with every request.
    The array-based key/value format sends one header per value.
<8> A mechanism for changing the date suffix used by default.

[[monitoring-tribe]]
=== Configuring a Tribe Node to Work with Monitoring

If you connect to a cluster through a https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-tribe.html[tribe node],
and you want to monitor the tribe node, then you will need to install X-Pack on that node as well.

With this configuration, the tribe node is included in the node count displayed in the Monitoring UI,
but is not included in the node list because it does not export any data to the monitoring cluster.

To include the tribe node in the monitoring data, enable Monitoring data collection at the tribe level:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------
node.name: my-tribe-node1

tribe:
  on_conflict: prefer_cluster1
  c1:
    cluster.name: cluster1
    discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [ "cluster1-node1:9300", "cluster1-node2:9300", "cluster1-node2:9300" ]
    xpack.monitoring.enabled: true <1>
  c2:
    cluster.name: cluster2
    discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [ "cluster2-node3:9300", "cluster2-node3:9300", "cluster2-node3:9300" ]
    xpack.monitoring: <2>
      enabled: true
      exporters:
        id1:
          type: http
          host: [ "monitoring-cluster:9200" ]
----------------------------------
<1> Enable data collection from the tribe node using a Local Exporter.
<2> Enable data collection from the tribe node using an HTTP Exporter.

When you enable data collection from the tribe node, it is included in both the node count and node list.
