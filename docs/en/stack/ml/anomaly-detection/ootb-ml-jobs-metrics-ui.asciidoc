These {anomaly-jobs} can be created in the
{observability-guide}/analyze-metrics.html[{metrics-app}] in {kib}.

The jobs below detect anomalous memory and network behavior on hosts and 
Kubernetes pods. For more details, see the {dfeed} and job definitions in the 
`metrics_ui_*` folders in 
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/{branch}/x-pack/plugins/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules[GitHub].
