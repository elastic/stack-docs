After the {anomaly-job} has processed some data, you can view the results in
{kib}.

TIP: Depending on the capacity of your machine, you might need to wait a few
seconds for the {ml} analysis to generate initial results.

There are two tools for examining the results from {anomaly-jobs} in {kib}: the
**Anomaly Explorer** and the **Single Metric Viewer**.

//TBD Provide overview of the different purposes of the two interfaces.

//Intro to swimlanes in Anomaly Explorer
