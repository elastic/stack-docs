=== VNC (Virtual Network Computing) to the Internet

Detects network events that may indicate the use of VNC traffic to the
Internet. VNC is commonly used by system administrators to remotely control a
system for maintenance or to use shared resources. It should almost never be
directly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by
threat actors as an initial access or back-door vector.

==== Potential false positives

VNC connections may be made directly to Linux cloud server instances but such
connections are usually made only by engineers. VNC is less common than SSH or
RDP but may be required by some work flows such as remote access and support
for specialized software products or servers. Such workflows are usually
known and not unexpected. Usage that is unfamiliar to server or network
owners can be unexpected and suspicious.

==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
network.transport: tcp and (destination.port >= 5800 and
destination.port <= 5810) and ( network.direction: outbound or (
source.ip: (10.0.0.0/8 or 172.16.0.0/12 or 192.168.0.0/16) and
not destination.ip: (10.0.0.0/8 or 172.16.0.0/12 or 192.168.0.0/16)
) )
