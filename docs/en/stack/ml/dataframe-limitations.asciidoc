==== Filtering limitations

On the _Create {dataframe} page_, there are two ways to select fields to grouping 
your data: the Group by drop-down menu on the left side and the checkboxes in the 
source index view on the right side (click the cogwheel in the right side of the 
source index view to see the available fields).
The drop-down menu uses the {es} mappings to show the fields while the source 
index only displays the fields returned from a basic search (the first 100 docs). 
Therefore there can be a mismatch if mappings are inexact.
