=== Explore and filter metrics data

Use the Metrics app in {kib} to monitor your infrastructure metrics and identify problems in real time.
You can explore metrics for hosts, containers, and services.
You can also drill down to view more detailed metrics, or seamlessly switch to view the corresponding logs, application traces, and uptime information.

Initially, the *Inventory* tab shows an overview of the hosts in of your infrastructure and the current CPU usage for each host.
From here, you can view other metrics or drill down into areas of interest.

==== Choose the high-level view of your infrastructure

Select the high-level view from *Hosts*, *Kubernetes*, or *Docker*.
When you change views, you see the same data through the perspective of a different category.

The default representation is the *Map view*, which shows your components in a _waffle map_ of one or more rectangular grids.
If the view you select has a large number of components, you can hover over a component to see the details for that component. Alternatively, if you would prefer to see your infrastructure as a table, click *Table view*.
