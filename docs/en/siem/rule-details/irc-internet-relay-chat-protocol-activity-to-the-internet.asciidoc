=== IRC (Internet Relay Chat) Protocol Activity to the Internet

Detects events that use common ports for Internet Relay Chat (IRC) to
the Internet. IRC is a common protocol that can be used for chat and file
transfers. This protocol is also a good candidate for remote control of malware
and data transfers to and from a network.

==== Potential false positives

IRC activity may be normal behavior for developers and engineers but is unusual
for non-engineering end users. IRC activity involving an unusual source or
destination may be more suspicious. IRC activity involving a production server
is often suspicious. Because these ports are in the ephemeral range, this rule
may false under certain conditions, such as when a NAT-ed web server replies to
a client which has used a port in the range by coincidence. In this case, these
servers can be excluded. Some legacy applications may use these ports, but this
is very uncommon and usually only appears in local traffic using private IPs,
which does not match this rule's conditions.

==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
network.transport: tcp and destination.port:(6667 or 6697) and (
network.direction: outbound or ( source.ip: (10.0.0.0/8 or
172.16.0.0/12 or 192.168.0.0/16) and not destination.ip:
(10.0.0.0/8 or 172.16.0.0/12 or 192.168.0.0/16) ) )
