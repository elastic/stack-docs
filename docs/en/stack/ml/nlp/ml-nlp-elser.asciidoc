Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR - or ELSER - is a retrieval model trained by 
Elastic that enables you to perform 
{ref}/semantic-search-elser.html[semantic search] to retrieve more relevant 
search results. This search type provides you search results based on contextual 
meaning and user intent, rather than exact keyword matches.

ELSER is an out-of-domain model which means it does not require fine-tuning on 
your own data, making it adaptable for various use cases out of the box.

[[elser-tokens]]
== Tokens - not synonyms

ELSER expands the indexed and searched passages into collections of terms that 
are learned to co-occur frequently within a diverse set of training data. The 
terms that the text is expanded into by the model _are not_ synonyms for the 
search terms; they are learned associations capturing relevance. These expanded 
terms are weighted as some of them are more significant than others. Then the 
{es} {ref}/rank-features.html[rank features] field type is used to store the 
terms and weights at index time, and to search against later.

This approach provides a more understandable search experience compared to 
vector embeddings. However, attempting to directly interpret the tokens and 
weights can be misleading, as the expansion essentially results in a vector in a 
very high-dimensional space. Consequently, certain tokens, especially those with 
low weight, contain information that is intertwined with other low-weight tokens 
in the representation. In this regard, they function similarly to a dense vector 
representation, making it challenging to separate their individual 
contributions. This complexity can potentially lead to misinterpretations if not 
carefully considered during analysis.


[discrete]
[[elser-req]]
== Requirements

To use ELSER, you must have the {subscriptions}[appropriate subscription] level 
for semantic search or the trial period activated.

NOTE: The minimum dedicated ML node size for deploying and using the ELSER model 
is 4 GB in Elasticsearch Service if 
{cloud}/ec-autoscaling.html[deployment autoscaling] is turned off. Turning on 
autoscaling is recommended because it allows your deployment to dynamically 
adjust resources based on demand. Better performance can be achieved by using 
more allocations or more threads per allocation, which requires bigger ML nodes. 
Autoscaling provides bigger nodes when required. If autoscaling is turned off, 
you must provide suitably sized nodes yourself.

[[elser-benchamrks]]
== Benchmarks

The following sections provide information about how ELSER performs on different 
hardwares and compares the model performance to {es} BM25 and other strong 
baselines such as Splade or OpenAI.

[[elser-hw-benchamrks]]
=== Hardware benchmarks

Two data sets were utilized to evaluate the performance of ELSER in different 
hardware configurations: `msmarco-long-light` and `arguana`.

|==============================================================================================================
| **Data set**             ^| **Data set size**   ^| **Average count of tokens / query** ^| **Average count of tokens / document**
| `msmarco-long-light`     ^| 37367 documents     ^| 9                                   ^| 1640                              
| `arguana`                ^| 8674 documents      ^| 238                                 ^| 202                               
|==============================================================================================================

The `msmarco-long-light` data set contains long documents with an average of 
over 512 tokens, which provides insights into the performance implications 
of indexing and {infer} time for long documents. This is a subset of the 
"msmarco" dataset specifically designed for document retrieval (it shouldn't be 
confused with the "msmarco" dataset used for passage retrieval, which primarily 
consists of shorter spans of text). 

The `arguana` data set is a https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir[BEIR] data set. 
It consists of long queries with an average of 200 tokens per query. It can 
represent an upper limit for query slowness.

The table below present benchmarking results for ELSER using various hardware 
configurations.

[[elser-qualitative-benchmarks]]
=== Qualitative benchmarks

The metric that is used to evaluate ELSER's ranking ability is the Normalized 
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) which can handle multiple relevant documents 
and fine-grained document ratings. The metric is applied to a fixed-sized list 
of retrieved documents which, in this case, is the top 10 documents (NDCG@10).

The table below shows the performance of ELSER compared to {es} BM25 with an 
English analyzer broken down by the 12 data sets used for the evaluation. ELSER 
has 10 wins, 1 draw, 1 loss and an average improvement in NDCG@10 of 17%.

_NDCG@10 for BEIR data sets for BM25 and ELSER  - higher values are better)_

The following table compares the average performance of ELSER to some other 
strong baselines. The OpenAI results are separated out because they use a 
different subset of the BEIR suite.

[discrete]
[[dev-console]]
=== Using the Dev Console

1. In {kib}, navigate to the **Dev Console**.
2. Create the ELSER model configuration by running the following API call:
+
--
[source,console]
----------------------------------
PUT _ml/trained_models/.elser_model_1
{
  "input": {
	"field_names": ["text_field"]
  }
}
----------------------------------

The API call automatically initiates the model download if the model is not 
downloaded yet.
--
3. Deploy the model by using the 
{ref}/start-trained-model-deployment.html[start trained model deployment API] 
with a delpoyment ID:
+
--
[source,console]
----------------------------------
POST _ml/trained_models/.elser_model_1/deployment/_start?deployment_id=for_search
----------------------------------

You can deploy the model multiple times with different deployment IDs.
--

After the deployment is complete, ELSER is ready to use either in an ingest 
pipeline or in a `text_expansion` query to perform semantic search.


[discrete]
[[air-gapped-install]]
== Deploy ELSER in an air-gapped environment

If you want to deploy ELSER in a restricted or closed network, you have two 
options:

* create your own HTTP/HTTPS endpoint with the model artifacts on it,
* put the model artifacts into a directory inside the config directory on all 
{ref}/modules-node.html#master-node[master-eligible nodes].

You need the following files in your system:

```
https://ml-models.elastic.co/elser_model_1.metadata.json
https://ml-models.elastic.co/elser_model_1.pt
https://ml-models.elastic.co/elser_model_1.vocab.json
```


[discrete]
=== Using an HTTP server

INFO: If you use an existing HTTP server, note that the model downloader only 
supports passwordless HTTP servers.

You can use any HTTP service to deploy ELSER. This example uses the official 
Nginx Docker image to set a new HTTP download service up.

. Download the model artifact files from https://ml-models.elastic.co/.
. Put the files into a subdirectory of your choice.
. Run the following commands:
+
--
[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
export ELASTIC_ML_MODELS="/path/to/models"
docker run --rm -d -p 8080:80 --name ml-models -v ${ELASTIC_ML_MODELS}:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
--------------------------------------------------

Don't forget to change `/path/to/models` to the path of the subdirectory where 
the model artifact files are located.

These commands start a local Docker image with an Nginx server with the 
subdirectory containing the model files. As the Docker image has to be 
downloaded and built, the first start might take a longer period of time. 
Subsequent runs start quicker.
--
. Verify that Nginx runs properly by visiting the following URL in your 
browser:
+
--
```
http://{IP_ADDRESS_OR_HOSTNAME}:8080/elser_model_1.metadata.json
```

If Nginx runs properly, you see the content of the metdata file of the model.
--
. Point your Elasticsearch deployment to the model artifacts on the HTTP server
by adding the following line to the `config/elasticsearch.yml` file: 
+
--
```
xpack.ml.model_repository: http://{IP_ADDRESS_OR_HOSTNAME}:8080
```

If you use your own HTTP or HTTPS server, change the address accordingly. It is 
important to specificy the protocol ("http://" or "https://"). Ensure that all 
master-eligible nodes can reach the server you specify.
--
. Repeat step 5 on all master-eligible nodes.
. {ref}/restart-cluster.html#restart-cluster-rolling[Restart] the 
master-eligible nodes one by one. 

The HTTP server is only required for downloading the model. After the download 
has finished, you can stop and delete the service. You can stop the Docker image 
used in this example by running the following command:

[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
docker stop ml-models
--------------------------------------------------


[discrete]
=== Using file-based access

For a file-based access, follow these steps:

. Download the model artifact files from https://ml-models.elastic.co/.
. Put the files into a `models` subdirectory inside the `config` directory of 
your Elasticsearch deployment.
. Point your Elasticsearch deployment to the model directory by adding the 
following line to the `config/elasticsearch.yml` file:
+
--
```
xpack.ml.model_repository: file://${path.home}/config/models/`
```
--
. Repeat step 2 and step 3 on all master-eligible nodes.
. {ref}/restart-cluster.html#restart-cluster-rolling[Restart] the 
master-eligible nodes one by one.
