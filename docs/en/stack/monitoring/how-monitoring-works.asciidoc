== How monitoring works

Monitoring collects data from {es} nodes, Logstash nodes, and {kib} instances. 

In general, the {es} cluster you are monitoring controls where the monitoring 
metrics for the stack are stored. By default, they are stored in local indices. 

In production, we strongly recommend using a separate monitoring cluster. Using 
a separate monitoring cluster prevents production cluster outages from impacting
your ability to access your monitoring data. It also prevents monitoring
activities from impacting the performance of your production cluster. The 
following diagram illustrates a typical monitoring architecture with separate 
production and monitoring clusters:

beta[] In 6.4 and later, you can use {metricbeat} to collect and ship data about 
{kib}, rather than routing it through {es}. In 6.5 and later, you can also use 
{metricbeat} to collect and ship data about {es}. For example:

If you have at least a gold license, you can route data from multiple production
clusters to a single monitoring cluster. For more information about the 
differences between various subscription levels, see: https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions 

IMPORTANT: In general, the monitoring cluster and the clusters being monitored
should be running the same version of the stack. A monitoring cluster cannot
monitor production clusters running newer versions of the stack. If necessary,
the monitoring cluster can monitor production clusters running older versions,
but the versions cannot differ by more than one major version.

If you use {kib} to visualize data and administer the cluster, you might want to 
create a dedicated {kib} instance for monitoring, rather than using a single 
{kib} instance to access both your production cluster and monitoring cluster:
