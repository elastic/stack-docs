[[glossary-field-reference]] field reference::
A reference to an event <<glossary-field,field>>. This reference may appear in
an output block or filter block in the {ls} config file. Field references
are typically wrapped in square (`[]`) brackets, for example `[fieldname]`. If
you are referring to a top-level field, you can omit the `[]` and simply use
the field name. To refer to a nested field, you specify the full path to that
field: `[top-level field][nested field]`.
