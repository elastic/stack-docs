=== Setuid Bit Set via chmod

An adversary may add the setuid bit to a file or directory in order to run a file with the privileges of the owning user. An adversary can take advantage of this to either do a shell escape or exploit a vulnerability in an application with the setuid bit to get code running in a different userâ€™s context. Additionally, adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.
