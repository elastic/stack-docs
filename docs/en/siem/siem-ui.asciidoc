== SIEM UI

The {siem-app} is a highly interactive workspace designed for security 
analysts. It provides a clear, detailed overview of events from your 
environment, and you can use the interactive UI to drill down into areas of 
interest.

The *{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)]* bar is available
throughout the {siem-app} for searching and filtering.

NOTE: The default index glob patterns defined for {siem-soln} events are 
`endgame-*`, `auditbeat-*`, `winlogbeat-*`, `filebeat-*`, `packetbeat-*`,
and `apm-*-transaction*`. You can change the default glob patterns in {kib} -> 
Management -> Advanced Settings -> `siem:defaultIndex`.

[[siem-overview-ui]]
=== Overview

The Overview page provides a high-level view into security events available
for analysis, and can help surface problems with data ingestion.

Notice the *Timeline* on the right of the {siem-ui}. It is always available for
starting an investigation, whether in its collapsed or expanded state. Identify
items you want to dig into, and drag and drop them to the Timeline. Those items
are waiting for you when you are ready to start your investigation.

[float]
[[hosts-ui]]
=== Hosts

The Hosts view provides key metrics regarding host-related security
events, and a set of data tables that let you interact with the Timeline Event
Viewer. You can drag and drop items of interest from the Hosts view tables to
Timeline for further investigation.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/hosts-ui.png[]

Interactive widgets let you drill down for deeper insights:

* Hosts
* User Authentications (success and failures)
* Unique IPs

There are also tabs for viewing and investigating specific types of data:

* All hosts: high-level host details
* Authentications: authentication events
* Uncommon processes: uncommon processes running on hosts
* Anomalies: anomalies discovered by <<machine-learning, machine learning jobs>>
* Events: all host events
* <<det-engine-terminology, External alerts>>: alerts received from 
external monitoring tools, such as Elastic Endpoint Security


*Host details* shows information for a selected host, including
Host ID, First Seen timestamp, Last Seen timestamp, IP and MAC addresses, OS,
versions, machine type, and so forth. Additionally, it contains all the widgets
and tabs relevant for the selected host.

[float]
[[network-ui]]
=== Network

The Network view provides key network activity metrics and an interactive map,
facilitates investigation time enrichment, and provides network event tables 
that enable interaction with the Timeline. You can drag and drop items of 
interest from the Network view to Timeline for further investigation.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/network-ui.png[]

Interactive widgets let you drill down for deeper insights:

* Network events
* DNS queries
* Unique flow IDs
* TLS handshakes
* Unique private IPs

There are also tabs for viewing and investigating specific types of data:

* Flows: source and destination IP addresses and countries
* DNS: DNS network queries
* HTTP: received HTTP requests (HTTP requests for applications using
{apm-app-ref}/apm-getting-started.html[Elastic APM] are monitored by default)
* TLS: handshake details
* Anomalies: anomalies discovered by <<machine-learning, machine learning jobs>>
* <<det-engine-terminology, External alerts>>: alerts received from 
external monitoring tools, such as Elastic Endpoint Security

[float]
[[map-ui]]
=== Map
The map provides a visual overview of your network traffic. It is interactive,
so you can start exploring data directly from the map. Hover over source and
destination points to see more information, such as hostnames and IP addresses.
To drill down, click a point and use the filter icon to add a field to the
filter bar or drag a field to the Timeline. You can also click a hostname
to jump to the SIEM Host page, or an IP address to open the relevant network 
details.

Just as you can start an investigation using the map, the map refreshes to show
relevant data when you run a query or update the time frame.

TIP: To add and remove layers, click on the more options icon in the top right
corner of the map.

<<conf-map-ui>> describes how to add map data and set up interactions.

[float]
[[detection-engine-ui]]
=== Detections

The Detections page provides an overview of all the signals created by 
signal detection rules. It is also the place where you can enable prebuilt 
rules and create new rules. <<detection-engine-overview>> provides a detailed 
description of Detections and how to use it.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/detections-ui.png[]

The `Signal count` histogram shows the detection rate of signals 
according to various attributes, including `Risk scores`, `Severities`, and 
`Top event categories`. The `All signals` table helps with investigations, 
allowing you to search, filter, and aggregate all {siem-soln} signals.

[float]
[[timelines-ui]]
=== Timelines

Use timelines as your workspace for alert investigations or threat hunting.
Data from multiple indices can be added to a timeline, which enables investigating
complex threats, such as lateral movement of malware across hosts in your network.

You can drag objects of interest into the Timeline Event Viewer to create
exactly the query filter you need to get to the bottom of an alert. You can drag
items from table widgets within Hosts and Network pages, or even from within
Timeline itself.

A timeline is responsive and persists as you move through the {siem-app}
collecting data. Auto-saving ensures that the results of your investigation are
available for review by other analysts and incident response teams.


[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-ui.png[]

Add notes for your own use and to communicate your workflow and findings to
others. You can share a timeline, or pass it off to another person or team. You
can link to timelines from a ticketing system.


[float]
[[raw]]
==== Focus on signals or raw events

Many security events in Timeline are presented in an easy-to-follow rendered
view, which enables quicker analyst understanding. Using the drop-down options 
by the KQL bar, you can select whether <<det-engine-terminology, signals>>, 
other raw events, or both are displayed in the Timeline.

You can click and expand events from within Timeline to see the underlying 
event data, either in tabular form, as as {es} JSON.

[float]
[[narrow-expand]]
==== Narrow or expand your query

You can specify logical `AND` and `OR` operations with an item's placement in
the drop area. Horizontal filters are `AND`-ed together. Vertical filters or
sets are `OR`-ed together. As you hover the item over the drop area, you can see
whether your placement is on target to create an `AND` or `OR` filters.

[float]
[[pivot]]
==== Pivot on a data point 

Click a filter to access additional operations such as exclude, temporarily
disable, or delete items from the query. For example, you can change an included
item so that it is excluded.

[float]
[[row-renderer]]
==== Get more context for each event

As you build and modify your queries, you can see the results of your
interactions in the details pane below.

As your query takes shape, an easy-to-follow rendered view appears for events. 
It shows relevant contextual information that helps tell the backstory of the
event. If you see a particular item that interests you, you can drag it to the
drop area for further introspection.

[float]
[[other]]
==== Other actions

The Timeline is flexible and highly interactive.  As you would expect, the
{siem-app} lets you:

* add, remove, reorder, or resize Timeline columns
* save, open, and list Timelines
* add notes to individual events
* add investigation notes for the whole Timeline
* pin events to the Timeline for persistence

Try clicking to expand or collapse items, or dragging and dropping them to other
areas to see what happens. Are there interactions that you would expect to see
that aren't present?  Let us know. We welcome your input.

[[conf-map-ui]]
=== Configuring map data

Depending on your {kib} setup, to display and interact with data on the map you
might need to:

* <<kibana-index-pattern>>
* <<geoip-data, Add geographical IP data to events>>
* <<private-network>>

NOTE: To see source and destination connections lines on the map, you must
configure `source.geo` and `destination.geo` ECS fields for your indices.

[[kibana-index-pattern]]
==== Create {kib} index patterns

To display map data, you must define {kib}
{kibana-ref}/tutorial-define-index.html[index patterns] (*Management* -> 
*Index Patterns*) that match the names or glob patterns used to define
{siem-soln} {es} indices.

NOTE: The {siem-soln} {es} indices are defined in the `siem:defaultIndex` field 
(*{kib}* -> *Management* -> *Advanced Settings* -> *`siem:defaultIndex`*).

For example, if you define a {siem-soln} {es} `servers-europe-*` glob pattern, 
to display map data for the matching indices you must also define a {kib} index 
pattern that matches `servers-europe-*`, such as `servers-*`.

[[geoip-data]]
==== Add geoIP data

When the ECS {ecs-ref}/ecs-geo.html[source.geo.location and 
destination.geo.location] fields are mapped, network data is displayed on
the map.

If you use Beats, configure a geoIP processor to add data to the relevant 
fields:

[[geo-pipeleine]]
. Define an ingest node pipeline that uses one or more `geoIP` processors to add
location information to events. For example, use the Console in {kib} to create
the following pipeline:
+
--
[source,json]
----
PUT _ingest/pipeline/geoip-info
{
  "description": "Add geoip info",
  "processors": [
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "client.ip",
        "target_field": "client.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "source.ip",
        "target_field": "source.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "destination.ip",
        "target_field": "destination.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "server.ip",
        "target_field": "server.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "host.ip",
        "target_field": "host.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
//CONSOLE
--
+
In this example, the pipeline ID is `geoip-info`. `field` specifies the field
that contains the IP address to use for the geographical lookup, and
`target_field` is the field that will hold the geographical information.
`"ignore_missing": true` configures the pipeline to continue processing when
it encounters an event that doesn't have the specified field.

. In your Beats configuration files, add the pipeline to the 
`output.elasticsearch`tag:
+
[source,yml]
----------------------------------
  output.elasticsearch:
    hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
    pipeline: geoip-info <1>
----------------------------------
<1> The value of this field must be the same as the ingest pipeline name in
<<geo-pipeleine, step 1>> (`geoip-info` in this example).

[[private-network]]
==== Map your internal network

If you want to add your network’s internal IP addresses to the map, define geo
location fields under the `processors` tag in the Beats configuration files
on your hosts:

[source,yml]
----------------------------------
  processors:
   - add_host_metadata:
   - add_cloud_metadata: ~
   - add_fields:
       when.network.source.ip: <private/IP address> <1>
       fields:
         source.geo.location:
           lat: <latitude coordinate>
           lon: <longitude coordinate>
       target: ''
   - add_fields:
       when.network.destination.ip: <private/IP address>
       fields:
         destination.geo.location:
           lat: <latitude coordinate>
           lon: <longitude coordinate>
       target: ''
----------------------------------
<1> For the IP address, you can use either `private` or CIDR notation.

TIP: You can also enrich your data with other
{packetbeat-ref}/add-host-metadata.html[host fields].
