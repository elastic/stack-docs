== How a {dfanalytics-job} works

A {dfanalytics-job} is essentially a persistent {es} task. During its life 
cycle, it goes through four phases:

* reindexing,
* loading data,
* analyzing,
* writing results.

Let's take a look at the phases one-by-one.

[[ml-dfa-phases-reindex]]
=== Reindexing

During the reindexing phase the documents from the source index or indices are 
copied to the destination index. If you want to define settings or mappings, 
create the index before you start the job. Otherwise, the job creates it using 
default settings.

Once the destination index is built, the {dfanalytics-job} task calls the {es} 
{ref}/docs-reindex.html[Reindex API] to launch the reindexing task.

[[ml-dfa-phases-load]]
=== Loading data

After the reindexing is finished, the job fetches the needed data from the 
destination index. It converts the data into the format that the analysis process 
expects, then sends it to the analysis process.

[[ml-dfa-phases-analyze]]
=== Analyzing

When all the required data is loaded, the analyzing phase begins. The exact 
process always depends on the type of {dfanalytics} – for example, 
{classification} or {oldetection} – that is executed. This is the phase when the 
job generates a {ml} model for analyzing the dataset.

[[ml-dfa-phases-write]]
=== Writing results

After the loaded data is analyzed, the analysis process sends back the results. 
Only the additional fields that the analysis calculated are written back, the 
ones that have been loaded in the loading data phase are not. The 
{dfanalytics-job} matches the results with the data rows in the destination 
index, merges them, and indexes them back to the destination index. When the 
process is complete, the task is marked as completed and the {dfanalytics-job} 
stops. Your data is ready to be evaluated.

various {dfanalytics} types.

evaluation of the {dfanalytics} results.
