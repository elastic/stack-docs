== Prebuilt {anomaly-jobs}

{anomaly-jobs-cap} contain the configuration information and metadata necessary 
to perform an analytics task. {kib} can recognize certain types of data and 
provide specialized wizards for that context. This page lists the available 
prebuilt {anomaly-jobs} that you can use via {kib}. Every module item in the 
list contains a name, a short description, information about 
the {ml-docs}/ml-buckets.html#ml-buckets[`bucket_span`] and the 
{ml-docs}/ml-functions.html[analysis function] as well as the influencers – the 
entities that have contributed to, or are to blame for, the anomalies – of the 
{anomaly-detect} job.
