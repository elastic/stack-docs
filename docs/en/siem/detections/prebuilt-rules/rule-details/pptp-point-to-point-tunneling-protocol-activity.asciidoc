detection.

==== Potential false positives

Some networks may utilize PPTP protocols but this is uncommon as more modern VPN
technologies are available. Usage that is unfamiliar to local network
administrators can be unexpected and suspicious. Torrenting applications may use
this port. Because this port is in the ephemeral range, this rule may false
under certain conditions, such as when an application server replies to a client
that used this port by coincidence. This is uncommon but such servers can be
excluded.
