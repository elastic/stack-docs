:description: ELSER is a learned sparse ranking model trained by Elastic.

Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder - or ELSER - is a large language model (LLM) 
trained by Elastic. It's a retrieval model that transforms the input text into 
high dimensional sparse vector representations, which can be used to calculate 
similarity. Sparse vectors can then be compared and used for various NLP tasks, 
such as semantic search.

ELSER is a model that can provide good results in out-of-domain data without the 
need of fine-tuning.
