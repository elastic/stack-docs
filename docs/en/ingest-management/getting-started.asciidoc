= Getting Started

// Scenario 1: use elastic-agent in standalone mode to send data to ES
// this assumes a locally running nginx service that can be monitored with
// metricbeat and filebeat

// Enable Ingest Manager in Kibana
// - in cloud
// - in local installation

// Navigate to ingest manager to ensure base & system packages are installed
// Install nginx package

// download and install elastic-agent
// configure it to run without using fleet for enrolling
// run it

// go back to Kibana, navigate to the data stream page
// find your data
// navigate to dashboards
// hooray!

// Scenario 2: use Fleet to configure the agent, enrol elastic-agent in fleet
// this too assumes a locally running nginx service

// Enable Ingest Manager & Fleet in Kibana
// - in cloud
// - in local installation

// Navigate to ingest manager and install nginx package
// Navigate to Fleet submenu, enable Fleet

// Enrol agent through UI & on command line (as instructed by UI)
// run it

// go back to Kibana, navigate to the data stream page
// find your data, rejoice etc.

// Unenrol agent from UI
// verify that it can't send data anymore
