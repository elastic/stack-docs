=== Machine learning nodes

A {ml} node is a node that has `xpack.ml.enabled` and `node.ml` set to `true`, which is the default behavior. If you set `node.ml` to `false`, the node can
service API requests but it cannot run jobs. If you want to use {ml-features},
there must be at least one {ml} node in your cluster. For more
information, see {ref}/modules-node.html#ml-node[Machine learning node].
