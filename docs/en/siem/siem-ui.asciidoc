== SIEM UI

IMPORTANT: This document is a work in progress. 
It covers features scheduled for beta release in 7.2.

beta[]

After you have your {siem-soln} data sources <<install-siem,up and running>> and
security events are streaming to {es}, check out the {siem-app} in {kib}. You
can view and analyze security events, investigate previous threat detections, or
hunt for new potential security issues.

The {siem-app} is a highly interactive workspace for security analysts. It is
designed to be discoverable, clickable, draggable and droppable, expandable and
collapsible, resizable, moveable, and so forth.

The *{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)]* bar is available
throughout the {siem-app} for searching and filtering.

NOTE: The default index patterns for {siem-soln} events are `auditbeat-*`, `winlogbeat-*`,
`filebeat-*`, and `packetbeat-*`. You can change the default index patterns in
{kib} -> Management -> Advanced Settings -> `siem:defaultIndex`.

[[siem-overview-ui]]
=== Overview

The Overview page provides a high-level view into security events available
for analysis, and can help surface problems with data ingestion.

Notice the *Timeline* on the right of the {siem-ui}. It is always available for
starting an investigation, whether in its collapsed or expanded state. Identify
items you want to dig into, and drag and drop them to the Timeline. Those items
are waiting for you when you are ready to start your investigation.

[[hosts-ui]]
=== Hosts

The Hosts view provides key metrics regarding host-related security
events, and a set of data tables that let you interact with the Timeline Event
Viewer. You can drag and drop items of interest from the Hosts view tables to
Timeline for further investigation.

Interactive table widgets let you drill down for deeper insights:

* Hosts
* Unique IPs
* User Authentications (success and failures)
* Uncommon Processes
* Events


*Hosts Detail* shows information for a selected host, including
Host ID, First Seen timestamp, Last Seen timestamp, IP and MAC addresses, OS,
versions, machine type, and so forth.

[float]
[[network-ui]]
=== Network

The Network view provides key network activity metrics, facilitates
investigation time enrichment, and provides network event tables that enable
interaction with the Timeline. You can drag and drop items of interest from the
Network view to Timeline for further investigation.

Interactive table widgets let you drill down for deeper insights:

* Top Talkers
* Top DNS Domains
* IP Details
* Domains
* Users
* Transport Layer Security certs


[float]
[[timelines-ui]]
=== Timelines

Use timelines as your workspace for alert investigations or threat hunting. 

You can drag objects of interest into the Timeline Event Viewer to create
exactly the query filter you need to get to the bottom of an alert. You can drag
items from table widgets within Hosts and Network pages, or even from within
Timeline itself.

A timeline is responsive and persists as you move through the {siem-app}
collecting data. Auto-saving ensures that the results of your investigation are
available for review by other analysts and incident response teams.

Add notes for your own use and to communicate your workflow and findings to
others. You can share a timeline, or pass it off to another person or team. You
can link to timelines from a ticketing system.

[[raw]]
==== See raw event data 

Many security events in Timeline are presented in an easy-to-follow rendered
view, which enables quicker analyst understanding. You can click and expand
events from within Timeline to see the underlying event data, either in tabular
form, as as {es} JSON.

[float]
[[narrow-expand]]
==== Narrow or expand your query 

You can specify logical `AND` and `OR` operations with an item's placement in
the drop area. Horizontal filters are `AND`-ed together. Vertical filters or
sets are `OR`-ed together. As you hover the item over the drop area, you can see
whether your placement is on target to create an `AND` or `OR` filters.

[float]
[[pivot]]
==== Pivot your data 

Right-click a drop area filter to access additional operations to exclude, temporarily
disable, or delete the filter terms. For example, you can change an included
filter to an exclusion.

[float]
[[row-renderer]]
==== Get more context for each event
As you build and modify your queries, you can see the results of your
interactions in the details pane below. 

As your query takes shape, an easy-to-follow rendered view appears for each
event. It shows relevant contextual information that helps tell the backstory of
the event. If you see a particular item that interests you, you can drag it to
the drop area for further introspection.

[float]
[[other]]
==== Other actions 

The Timeline is flexible and highly interactive.  As you would expect, the
{siem-app} lets you:

* add, remove, or resize Timeline columns. 
* save, open, and list Timelines
* add notes to individual events
* add investigation notes for the whole Timeline
* pin events to the Timeline for persistence

Try clicking to expand or collapse items, or dragging and dropping them to other
areas to see what happens. Are there interactions that you would expect to see
that aren't present?  Let us know. We welcome your input.
