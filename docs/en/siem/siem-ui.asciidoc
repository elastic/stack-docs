[role="xpack"]
= SIEM UI

The {siem-app} is a highly interactive workspace designed for security
analysts. It provides a clear overview of events from your
environment, and you can use the interactive UI to drill down into areas of
interest.

The *{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)]* bar is available
throughout the {siem-app} for searching and filtering. You can also select
areas of interest in time-based histograms, which updates the timepicker.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/siem-click-swipe.png[]

TIP: All {siem-soln} histograms, graphs, and tables contain an **Inspect**
button, so you can examine the {es} queries used to retrieve data throughout
the app.

Chart legends and many grid fields are interactive. Fields that can be dragged
to <<timelines-ui, Timeline>> are indicated with two dotted vertical lines, and
are highlighted when you hover over a grid's row:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/siem-field-highlight.png[]

When a popup menu appears while hovering over a field, you can perform these
actions:

* Filter for value: adds the field to the filter bar
* Filter out value: adds the field with a `NOT` operator to the filter bar
* Add to Timeline investigation: adds the field to Timeline
* Show top <field name>: displays a histogram of the top field values
* Copy to clipboard: copies the field and its value to your clipboard, using
KQL syntax

NOTE: The default index glob patterns defined for {siem-soln} events are
`endgame-*`, `auditbeat-*`, `winlogbeat-*`, `filebeat-*`, `packetbeat-*`,
and `apm-*-transaction*`. You can change the default glob patterns in {kib} ->
Management -> Advanced Settings -> `siem:defaultIndex`.


[float]
[[siem-overview-ui]]
== Overview page

The Overview page provides a high-level view of security events available
for analysis, and can help surface problems with data ingestion.

[discrete]
[[search-overview]]
==== Search

Filter for signals, events, process and other important security information  with the benefit of *{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)]* in the SIEM search bar. A date/time filter set to `Last 24 hours` is enabled by default, but can be changed to any time range. If you want to filter your search results with other fields, select **Add Filter**, followed by the field from which to filter and the operator (such `is not` or `is between`) for your query.

To save specific filters and queries, click the Save icon and then **Save current query**.

[discrete]
[[timelines-overview]]
==== Timelines

Select the collapsable *Timeline* button on the right of the {siem-ui} to start an investigation. See the <<timelines-ui,Timelines>> section for more information.

The most recent timelines you've accessed appear in **Recent Timelines**.

[discrete]
[[signals-count]]
==== Signals count

The signals histogram displays a count of all the Signals detected by the {siem-app} within a set time frame. In the **Stack by** dropdown, select specific parameters for which to visualize the signal count. For example, stack by `user.name` for the graph to visualize the number of signals attributed to a specific user.

To create signal detection rules, see <<rules-ui-create,Managing Signal Detection Rules>>.

[discrete]
[[external-alerts-count]]
==== External alerts count

The external alerts histogram displays a count within a certain time frame. You can stack by two parameters: `event-category` or `event.module`.

[role="screenshot"]

[discrete]
[[events-count]]
==== Events count

The events count histogram displays a count of all events within a set time frame. You can stack by `event.action`, `event.dataset`, or `event.module`.


[discrete]
[[host-and-network-events]]
==== Host and network events

View event and host counts specific to Elastic data shippers and apps, such as **Auditbeats** or **Elastic Endpoint Security**. Expand each category for specific counts of hosts or network events related to the category.

[role="screenshot"]
image::events-count.png[]


[float]
[[hosts-ui]]
== Hosts page

The Hosts view provides key metrics regarding host-related security
events, and a set of data tables that let you interact with the Timeline Event
Viewer. You can drag and drop items of interest from the Hosts view tables to
Timeline for further investigation.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/hosts-ui.png[]

Interactive widgets let you drill down for deeper insights:

* Hosts
* User Authentications (success and failures)
* Unique IPs

There are also tabs for viewing and investigating specific types of data:

* All hosts: high-level host details
* Authentications: authentication events
* Uncommon processes: uncommon processes running on hosts
* Anomalies: anomalies discovered by <<machine-learning, machine learning jobs>>
* Events: all host events
* <<det-engine-terminology, External alerts>>: alerts received from
external monitoring tools, such as Elastic Endpoint Security


*Host detail* pages show information for a selected host, including
Host ID, First Seen timestamp, Last Seen timestamp, IP and MAC addresses, OS,
versions, machine type, and so forth. Additionally, it contains all the widgets
and tabs relevant for the selected host.

[float]
[[network-ui]]
== Network page

The Network view provides key network activity metrics and an interactive map,
and provides network event tables that enable interaction with the Timeline. You
can drag and drop items of interest from the Network view to Timeline for
further investigation.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/network-ui.png[]

Interactive widgets let you drill down for deeper insights:

* Network events
* DNS queries
* Unique flow IDs
* TLS handshakes
* Unique private IPs

There are also tabs for viewing and investigating specific types of data:

* Flows: source and destination IP addresses and countries
* DNS: DNS network queries
* HTTP: received HTTP requests (HTTP requests for applications using
{apm-app-ref}/apm-getting-started.html[Elastic APM] are monitored by default)
* TLS: handshake details
* Anomalies: anomalies discovered by <<machine-learning, machine learning jobs>>
* <<det-engine-terminology, External alerts>>: alerts received from
external monitoring tools, such as Elastic Endpoint Security

*IP detail* pages show information for the selected IP address, including
links to external sites for verifying the IP address's reputation. By default,
the external sites are https://talosintelligence.com/[TALOS] and
https://www.virustotal.com/[VIRUSTOTAL]. You can change the displayed
reputation links in *{kib}* -> *Management* -> *Advanced Settings* ->
*`siem:ipReputationLinks`*. The `siem:ipReputationLinks` setting contains a
JSON array with these fields:

* `name`: UI display name.
* `url_template`: URL of the link. It can include `{{ip}}`, which is placeholder for the IP address you are viewing on the details page.

For example:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
[
  { "name": "virustotal.com", "url_template": "https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/{{ip}}" },
  { "name": "dnschecker.org", "url_template": "https://www.dnschecker.org/ip-location.php?ip={{ip}}" },
  { "name": "talosIntelligence.com", "url_template": "https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/lookup?search={{ip}}" }
]
--------------------------------------------------

[discrete]
[[map-ui]]
==== Map
The map provides a visual overview of your network traffic. It is interactive,
so you can start exploring data directly from the map. Hover over source and
destination points to see more information, such as hostnames and IP addresses.
To drill down, click a point and use the filter icon to add a field to the
filter bar or drag a field to the Timeline. You can also click a hostname
to jump to the SIEM Host page, or an IP address to open the relevant network
details.

Just as you can start an investigation using the map, the map refreshes to show
relevant data when you run a query or update the time frame.

TIP: To add and remove layers, click on the more options icon in the top right
corner of the map.

<<conf-map-ui>> describes how to add map data and set up interactions.

[float]
[[detection-engine-ui]]
== Detections page

The Detections page provides an overview of all the signals created by
signal detection rules. It is also the place where you can enable prebuilt
rules and create new rules. <<detection-engine-overview>> provides a detailed
description of Detections and how to use it.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/detections-ui.png[]

The `Signal count` histogram shows the detection rate of signals
according to various attributes, including `Risk scores`, `Severities`, and
`Top event categories`. The `All signals` table helps with investigations,
allowing you to search, filter, and aggregate all {siem-soln} signals.

[float]
[[cases-ui]]
== Cases page

The Cases page is used to open and track security issues directly in the
{siem-app}. For more information, see <<cases-overview>>.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/cases-ui-home.png[]

[float]
[[timelines-ui]]
== Timelines

Use Timeline as your workspace for alert investigations or threat hunting.
Data from multiple indices can be added to a timeline, which enables
investigating complex threats, such as lateral movement of malware across hosts
in your network.

You can drag objects of interest into Timeline to create exactly the query
filter you need to get to the bottom of an alert. You can drag
items from table widgets within Hosts and Network pages, or even from within
Timeline itself.

A timeline is responsive and persists as you move through the {siem-app}
collecting data. Auto-saving ensures that the results of your investigation are
available for review by other analysts and incident response teams.


[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-ui.png[]

Add notes for your own use and to communicate your workflow and findings to
others. You can share a timeline, or pass it off to another person or team. You
can also link to timelines from Cases and external ticketing systems.


[discrete]
[[raw]]
==== Focus on signals or raw events

Many security events in Timeline are presented in an easy-to-follow rendered
view, which enables quicker analyst understanding. Using the drop-down options
by the KQL bar, you can select whether <<det-engine-terminology, signals>>,
other raw events, or both are displayed in the Timeline.

You can click and expand events from within Timeline to see the underlying
event data, either in tabular form, as as {es} JSON.

[discrete]
[[narrow-expand]]
==== Narrow or expand your query

You can specify logical `AND` and `OR` operations with an item's placement in
the drop area. Horizontal filters are `AND`-ed together. Vertical filters or
sets are `OR`-ed together. As you hover the item over the drop area, you can see
whether your placement is on target to create an `AND` or `OR` filters.

[discrete]
[[pivot]]
==== Pivot on a data point

Click a filter to access additional operations such as exclude, temporarily
disable, or delete items from the query. For example, you can change an included
item so that it is excluded.

[discrete]
[[row-renderer]]
==== Get more context for each event

As you build and modify your queries, you can see the results of your
interactions in the details pane below.

As your query takes shape, an easy-to-follow rendered view appears for events.
It shows relevant contextual information that helps tell the backstory of the
event. If you see a particular item that interests you, you can drag it to the
drop area for further introspection.

[discrete]
[[import-export-timelines]]
==== Export and import timelines

You can import and export timelines, which enables importing timelines from one
{kib} space or instance to another. Exported timelines are saved in an
http://ndjson.org[`ndjson`] file.

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Timelines*.
. To export timelines, do one of the following:

* To export one timeline, click the more actions icon in the relevant row and
then select _Export selected_.
* To export multiple timelines, select all the required timelines and then click
*Bulk actions* -> _Export selected_.

. To import timelines, click *Import Timeline* and then select or drap-and-drop
the timeline `ndjson` file.

[discrete]
[[other]]
==== Other actions

The Timeline is flexible and highly interactive.  As you would expect, the
{siem-app} lets you:

* add, remove, reorder, or resize Timeline columns
* save, open, and list Timelines
* add notes to individual events
* add investigation notes for the whole Timeline
* pin events to the Timeline for persistence

Try clicking to expand or collapse items, or dragging and dropping them to other
areas to see what happens. Are there interactions that you would expect to see
that aren't present?  Let us know. We welcome your input.

[[conf-map-ui]]
== Configuring map data

Depending on your {kib} setup, to display and interact with data on the map you
might need to:

* <<kibana-index-pattern>>
* <<geoip-data, Add geographical IP data to events>>
* <<private-network>>

NOTE: To see source and destination connections lines on the map, you must
configure `source.geo` and `destination.geo` ECS fields for your indices.

[float]
[[kibana-index-pattern]]
=== Create {kib} index patterns

To display map data, you must define {kib}
{kibana-ref}/tutorial-define-index.html[index patterns] (*Management* ->
*Index Patterns*) that match the names or glob patterns used to define
{siem-soln} {es} indices.

NOTE: The {siem-soln} {es} indices are defined in the `siem:defaultIndex` field
(*{kib}* -> *Management* -> *Advanced Settings* -> *`siem:defaultIndex`*).

For example, if you define a {siem-soln} {es} `servers-europe-*` glob pattern,
to display map data for the matching indices you must also define a {kib} index
pattern that matches `servers-europe-*`, such as `servers-*`.

[float]
[[geoip-data]]
=== Add geoIP data

When the ECS {ecs-ref}/ecs-geo.html[source.geo.location and
destination.geo.location] fields are mapped, network data is displayed on
the map.

If you use Beats, configure a geoIP processor to add data to the relevant
fields:

[[geo-pipeleine]]
. Define an ingest node pipeline that uses one or more `geoIP` processors to add
location information to events. For example, use the Console in {kib} to create
the following pipeline:
+
--
[source,json]
----
PUT _ingest/pipeline/geoip-info
{
  "description": "Add geoip info",
  "processors": [
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "client.ip",
        "target_field": "client.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "source.ip",
        "target_field": "source.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "destination.ip",
        "target_field": "destination.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "server.ip",
        "target_field": "server.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "host.ip",
        "target_field": "host.geo",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
//CONSOLE
--
+
In this example, the pipeline ID is `geoip-info`. `field` specifies the field
that contains the IP address to use for the geographical lookup, and
`target_field` is the field that will hold the geographical information.
`"ignore_missing": true` configures the pipeline to continue processing when
it encounters an event that doesn't have the specified field.
+
TIP: An example ingest pipeline that uses the GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb database to add
autonomous system number (ASN) fields can be found https://github.com/elastic/examples/blob/master/Security%20Analytics/SIEM-examples/Packetbeat/geoip-info.json[here]. 

. In your Beats configuration files, add the pipeline to the
`output.elasticsearch`tag:
+
[source,yml]
----------------------------------
  output.elasticsearch:
    hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
    pipeline: geoip-info <1>
----------------------------------
<1> The value of this field must be the same as the ingest pipeline name in
<<geo-pipeleine, step 1>> (`geoip-info` in this example).

[float]
[[private-network]]
=== Map your internal network

If you want to add your network’s internal IP addresses to the map, define geo
location fields under the `processors` tag in the Beats configuration files
on your hosts:

[source,yml]
----------------------------------
  processors:
   - add_host_metadata:
   - add_cloud_metadata: ~
   - add_fields:
       when.network.source.ip: <private/IP address> <1>
       fields:
         source.geo.location:
           lat: <latitude coordinate>
           lon: <longitude coordinate>
       target: ''
   - add_fields:
       when.network.destination.ip: <private/IP address>
       fields:
         destination.geo.location:
           lat: <latitude coordinate>
           lon: <longitude coordinate>
       target: ''
----------------------------------
<1> For the IP address, you can use either `private` or CIDR notation.

TIP: You can also enrich your data with other
{packetbeat-ref}/add-host-metadata.html[host fields].
