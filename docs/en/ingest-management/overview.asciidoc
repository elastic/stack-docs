== Ingest Management components

Ingest Management requires the following {stack} components.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[{es}]* is a real-time,
distributed storage, search, and analytics engine. {es} excels at indexing
streams of semi-structured data, such as logs or metrics.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[{kib}]* is an open source analytics and
visualization platform designed to work with {es}. You use {kib} to search,
view, and interact with data stored in {es} indices. You can easily perform
advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables,
and maps.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[{beats}]* are open source data shippers
that you install as agents on your systems. Ingest Management uses the elastic agent
to set up {beats} to send data to {es}.
