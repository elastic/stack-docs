== Breaking changes

Before you upgrade, you must review the breaking changes for each product you
use and make the necessary changes so your code is compatible with {version}. 

** {apm-server-ref}/breaking-changes.html[APM Server {version} breaking changes]
** {beats-ref}/breaking-changes.html[Beats {version} breaking changes]
** {ref}/breaking-changes.html[Elasticsearch {version} breaking changes]
** {hadoop-ref}/breaking-changes.html[Elasticsearch Hadoop {version} breaking changes]
** {kibana-ref}/breaking-changes.html[Kibana {version} breaking changes]
** {logstash-ref}/breaking-changes.html[Logstash {version} breaking changes]

[IMPORTANT]
===============================

* If you're upgrading from 2.n, make sure you check the breaking changes from
2.n to 5.n, as well as from 5.n to 6.n!
* If you are using {ml} {dfeeds} that contain discontinued search or query
domain specific language (DSL), the upgrade will fail. In 5.6.5 and later, the
Upgrade Assistant provides information about which {dfeeds} need to be updated.
