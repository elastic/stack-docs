[[glossary-searchable-snapshot-index]] searchable snapshot index::
<<glossary-index,Index>> whose data is stored in a
<<glossary-snapshot,snapshot>>. Searchable snapshot indices do not need
<<glossary-replica-shard,replica shards>> for resilience, since their data is
reliably stored outside the cluster. See
{ref}/searchable-snapshots.html[searchable snapshots].
