. In {ls}, this term refers to an <<glossary-event,event>> property. For
example, each event in an apache access log has properties, such as a status
code (200, 404), request path ("/", "index.html"), HTTP verb (GET, POST), client
IP address, and so on. {ls} uses the term "fields" to refer to these
properties.
