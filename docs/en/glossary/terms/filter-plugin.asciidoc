[[glossary-filter-plugin]] filter plugin::
A {ls} <<glossary-plugin,plugin>> that performs intermediary processing on
an <<glossary-event,event>>. Typically, filters act upon event data after it
has been ingested via inputs, by mutating, enriching, and/or modifying the

depending on the characteristics of the event. Popular filter plugins include
grok, mutate, drop, clone, and geoip. Filter stages are optional.
