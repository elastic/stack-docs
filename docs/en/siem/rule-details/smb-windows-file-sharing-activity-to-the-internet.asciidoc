=== SMB (Windows File Sharing) Activity to the Internet

Detects network events that may indicate the use of Windows file
sharing (also called SMB or CIFS) traffic to the Internet. SMB is commonly used
within networks to share files, printers, and other system resources amongst
trusted systems. It should almost never be directly exposed to the Internet, as
it is frequently targeted and exploited by threat actors as an initial access or
back-door vector or for data exfiltration.
