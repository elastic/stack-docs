=== Explore the data in {kib}

To get the best results from {ml} analytics, you must understand your data. You
must know its data types and the range and distribution of values. The
{data-viz} enables you to explore the fields in your data: 

. Open {kib} in your web browser. If you are running {kib} locally,
go to `http://localhost:5601/`.
+
--
TIP: The {kib} {ml-features} use pop-ups. You must configure your
web browser so that it does not block pop-up windows or create an
exception for your {kib} URL.

. Click *Machine Learning* in the side navigation.

. Select the *{data-viz}* tab.

. Click *Select index* and choose the `kibana_sample_data_logs` index pattern.

. Use the time filter to select a time period that you're interested in
exploring. Alternatively, click
*Use full kibana_sample_data_logs data* to view the full time range of data.

. Optional: Change the sample size, which is the number of documents per shard
that are used in the visualizations. There is a relatively small number of
documents in the sample data, so you can choose a value of `all`. For larger
data sets, keep in mind that using a large sample size increases query run times
and increases the load on the cluster.

. Explore the fields and metrics in the {data-viz}.

It lists the fields in two sections. The first section contains
the numeric ("metric") data types. The second section contains non-numeric data
types (such as `keyword`, `text`, `date`, `boolean`, `ip`, and `geo_point`). For
more information, see {ref}/mapping-types.html[Field data types].

For each metric, the {data-viz} indicates how many documents contain the field
in the selected time period. It also provides information about the minimum,
median, and maximum values, the number of distinct values, and their
distribution. You can use the distribution chart to get a better idea of how
the values in the data are clustered. Alternatively, you can view the top values
for metric fields. For example:

image::images/ml-gs-data-metric.jpg["{data-viz} output for top values in {kib}", width="50%",role="screenshot left"]

In particular, look at the `clientip`, `response.keyword`, and `url.keyword`
fields, since we'll use them in our {anomaly-jobs}. For
{ref}/ip.html[`ip`] and {ref}/keyword.html[`keyword`] fields, the {data-viz}
provides the number of distinct values, a list of the top values, and the number
and percentage of documents that contain the field during the selected time
period. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/ml-gs-data-keyword.jpg["{data-viz} output for keyword fields in {kib}", width="50%",role="screenshot left"]

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/ml-gs-data-ip.jpg["{data-viz} output for ip fields in {kib}", width="50%",role="screenshot left"]

. Make note of the range of dates in the `@timestamp` field. They are relative
to when you added the sample data and you'll need that information later in the
tutorial.
+
--
For {ref}/date.html[`date`] fields, the {data-viz} provides the earliest and
latest field values and the number and percentage of documents that contain the
field during the selected time period:

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/ml-gs-data-timestamp.jpg["{data-viz} output for date fields in {kib}",width="50%",role="screenshot left"]

Now that you're familiar with the data in the `kibana_sample_data_logs` index,
you can create some {anomaly-jobs} to analyze it.
