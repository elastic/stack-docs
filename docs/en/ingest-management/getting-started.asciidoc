= Getting Started

To use Ingest Management, you need an Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana (version 7.8 for the experimental release)
with a basic licence. See {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Getting started with the {stack}].

Notice: Since this is an experimental release, it should only be used in a dedicated test environment
that can be deleted when you are done. Please do not enable or use Ingest Management in a production
environment.

== Prerequisites

If you want to use Ingest Management, the following prerequisites have to be met in the Elasticsearch configuration:

- Elasticsearch security has to be enabled by setting `xpack.security.enabled` to `true`.
- API keys have to be enabled in Elasticsearch by setting `xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled` to `true`.

If you use our https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud, these settings will already be enabled.

In this experimental release, Ingest Management is only available to users with the superuser role, see
{ref}/built-in-roles.html // TODO: link correct?

For feedback and questions, please contact us https://ela.st/ingest-manager-feedback[here]. 

== Enable Ingest Management

To enable Ingest Management, make the following changes to the Kibana configuration:

- set `xpack.ingestManagement.enabled` to `true`

If you are using our https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud, you will need to add them to the Kibana user settings as described in 
{cloud}/ec-manage-kibana-settings.html // TODO: link correct?

If you are using an **on-premises** stack deployment, you will need to add them to the Kibana configuration
 as described in {kibana-ref}/settings.html // TODO: check link

To verify that Ingest Management has been correctly enabled, login to {kib} and use the menu to navigate to 
**Management** > **{ingest-manager}**. If the menu entry is visible, and you see the following start page
for {ingest-manager}, enabling Ingest Management has been successful.
// TODO: style guide for screenshot size or ratio?
// TODO: style guide for how to navigate the menu?

== Install an integration and create a data source

Ingest Management bundles various assets that are needed to ingest and visualize data in **integrations**.

In this Guide we assume that you have `nginx` running on some of your infrastructure, and want to
collect logs and metrics from it. To do so, first install the `nginx` integration provided by Elastic.

In the {ingest-manager} app, navigate to **Integrations** and use the search bar to find the Nginx integration.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-ingest-manager-integrations-nginx.png[{ingest-manager} app showing Nginx Integration]

Click on the Nginx integration to see more details about it. On the upper right, select **Create data source**.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-ingest-manager-integrations-nginx-overview.png[{ingest-manager} app showing Nginx Integration overview]

On the **Add data source** screen, click to select the default agent configuration from the list, and scroll down to inspect or change the
default settings that have been set for you. When you're done, click **Save data source**. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-ingest-manager-integrations-nginx-add-datasource.png[{ingest-manager} app Add data source screen]

Navigate back to the main **Integrations** tab and select **Installed Integrations**. The Nginx integration has been installed and
should show up in this list. (Note that the **System** and **Elastic Endpoint** integrations have been installed by default.)

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-ingest-manager-integrations-list-installed.png[{ingest-manager} app showing installed integrations]

Navigate to **Configurations** and click on the Default config in the list. On the detail view, the newly created data source should appear in the list. (Note that the `system-1` data source has been created by default.)

== Install and run elastic-agent

{agent} is a single, unified agent that you can deploy to hosts or containers to collect data and send it to the {stack}. Behind the scenes, {agent} runs the {beats} shippers or Endpoint required for your configuration. It can be configured manually or from the {ingest-manager} app in {kib}.

=== Installation

See {elastic-agent-ref}/elastic-agent.html for instructions how to install {agent} on your operating system.
// TODO link correct?
// TODO elastic-agent-ref is not yet defined in https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/shared/attributes.asciidoc


=== Standalone mode

To configure {agent} manually, navigate to **Configurations** in the {ingest-manager} app and click on the Default config in the list. Then select the **YAML** tab to access the configuration for {agent}. Copy the content and put it into a file `elastic-agent-standalone.yml` on the system where you have installed {agent}.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-ingest-manager-configurations-default-yaml.png[{ingest-manager} app showing default agent configuration in YAML format]

Please note that the configuration file generated by the {ingest-manager} app already contains the correct elasticsearch address and port for your setup. If you run everything locally, this will be `127.0.0.1:9200`. If you are using our https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud, this will correspond to the Elasticsearch endpoint URL that is also available under **Endpoints** as described in {cloud}/ec-working-with-elasticsearch.html.

You will also have to add your elasticsearch username and password to the `outputs` section in the configuration file:

```
[...]
outputs:
  default:
    type: elasticsearch
    hosts:
      - 'HOST:PORT'
    username: ES_USERNAME
    password: ES_PASSWORD
datasources:
[...]
```

Run {agent} with the command

```
$ ./elastic-agent -c elastic-agent-standalone.yml run
```

=== {fleet} mode

To use {fleet} to configure {agent}, you first need to enable {fleet} in the {ingest-manager} app. To do so, navigate to the **{fleet}** tab and click **Create user and enable Fleet**.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-ingest-manager-fleet-enable.png[{ingest-manager} app showing prompt to enable {fleet}]

On the next page, click on **Enroll new agent** to start the enrollment. Select an agent configuration (or stay with the default) and copy the command to enroll the agent from the command line. This line contains your Kibana URL and an enrollment key that has been generated by the {ingest-manager} app.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-ingest-manager-fleet-enrol.png[{ingest-manager} app showing agent enrollment dialog]

In the directory where you installed {agent}, paste the copied command to enroll the agent. Please note that this command will overwrite the `elastic-agent.yml` file in that directory.

```
$ ./elastic-agent enroll KIBANA_URL ENROLLMENT_KEY

The {agent} is currently in Experimental and should not be used in production
This will replace your current settings. Do you want to continue? [Y/n]:
```
After that, run the agent with
```
$ ./elastic-agent run
```

In the {ingest-manager} app, click **Continue** to get back to the **{fleet}** tab. This will now show the newly enrolled agent.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-ingest-manager-fleet-agents.png[{ingest-manager} app showing enrolled agents]

When you want to unenroll an agent, choose **Unenroll** from the **Actions** menu for this agent. This will invalidate the API key the agent is using to connect to {es}. The {agent} will continue to run, but will not be able to send data, and show this error instead:

```
invalid api key to authenticate with fleet
```

== View your data

Navigate to the **Data streams** tab in the {ingest-manager} app to inspect the data that is sent by the agent. From the **Actions** column you can navigate to the dashboards corresponding to the data type that is sent.
