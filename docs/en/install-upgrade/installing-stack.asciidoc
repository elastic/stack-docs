== Installing the Elastic Stack

When installing the Elastic Stack, you must use the same version
across the entire stack. For example, if you are using Elasticsearch
{version}, you install Beats {version}, APM Server {version}, Elasticsearch Hadoop {version},
Kibana {version}, and Logstash {version}.

If you're upgrading an existing installation, see <<upgrading-elastic-stack, Upgrading the Elastic Stack>> for information about how to ensure compatibility with {version}.

=== Installation Order

Install the Elastic Stack products you want to use in the following order:

. Elasticsearch ({ref}/install-elasticsearch.html[install instructions])
. Kibana ({kibana-ref}/install.html[install])
. Logstash ({logstash-ref}/installing-logstash.html[install])
. Beats ({beats-ref}/getting-started.html[install instructions])
. APM Server ({apm-server-ref-70}/installing.html[install instructions])
. Elasticsearch Hadoop ({hadoop-ref}/install.html[install instructions])

Installing in this order ensures that the components each product depends
on are in place.
