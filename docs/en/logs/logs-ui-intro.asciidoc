After setting up logs ingestion and log data is streaming to {es}, you can view real-time and historical logs in a compact, customizable display.
The log data is correlated with metrics data in the {metrics-guide}/metrics-app-overview.html[{metrics-app}], making it easier for you to diagnose problems.
You can also view related application traces or uptime information where available.

You can stream the logs in real time, or view historical logs from a specified time range.

The search bar in the log viewer supports {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language].
You can enter ad hoc or structured queries to filter the log entries.
