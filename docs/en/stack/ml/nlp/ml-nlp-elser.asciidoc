:description: ELSER is a learned sparse ranking model trained by Elastic.

Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder - or ELSER - is a large language model (LLM) 
trained by Elastic. As a retrieval model, ELSER transforms the input text into 
high dimensional sparse vector representations, which can be used to calculate 
similarity. Sparse vectors can then be compared and used for various NLP tasks, 
such as {ref}/semantic-search-elser.html[semantic search].

ELSER is a model that can provide fairly good results in out-of-domain data 
without the need of fine-tuning.
// TO DO: Refer to this blog post, to learn more about ELSER.

== Requirements

To use ELSER, you must have the {subscriptions}[appropriate subscription] level 
or the trial period activated.

[[download-elser]]
== Download ELSER

////
TO DO: Add back this section when the URL is working.
INFO: If you want to use ELSER in a restricted or closed network, follow the 
instructions <<ml-nlp-deploy-model-air-gapped,here>>.
////

You can download ELSER either from the Trained Models page in {kib} or by using 
the Dev Console.

[[trained-model]]
=== Using the Trained Models page

1. In {kib}, navigate to **{ml-app}** > **Trained Models**. ELSER can be found 
in the list of Trained Models.
2. Click the Download model button under **Actions**. You can check the download 
status on the **Notifications** page.

Your ELSER deployment is ready to be used in 

[discrete]
[[dev-console]]
=== Using the Dev Console

1. In {kib}, navigate to the **Dev Console**.
2. Create the ELSER model configuration by running the following API call:

[source,console]
----------------------------------
PUT _ml/trained_models/.elser_model_1
{
  "input": {
	"field_names": ["text_field"]
  }
}
----------------------------------

The API call automatically initiates the model download if the model is not 
downloaded yet.

[[deploy-elser]]
== Deploy ELSER

After you downloaded ELSER, you can use {kib} to view and manage its deployment 
across your cluster under **{ml-app}** > **Trained Models**.

1. Start the deployment by clicking the Start deployment button.
2. Provide a deployment ID, select priority, and set the number of allocations 
and threads per allocation values.

3. Click Start.

Alternatively, you can deploy the model by using the 
{ref}/start-trained-model-deployment.html[start trained model deployment API] 
with a delpoyment ID:

[source,console]
----------------------------------
POST _ml/trained_models/.elser_model_1/deployment/_start?deployment_id=for_search
----------------------------------

You can deploy the model multiple times with different deployment IDs.

After the deployment is complete, ELSER is ready to use either in an ingest 
pipeline or in a `text_expansion` query to perform semantic search.
