[[tuning-anomaly-results]]
=== Optimizing anomaly results

To gain clearer insights into real threats, you can tune the anomaly results. The following procedures help to reduce the number of false positives: 

* <<rarely-used-processes, Tune results for rare applications and processes>>
* <<define-rule-threshold>>

[[rarely-used-processes]]
==== Filter out anomalies from rarely used applications and processes

When anomalies include results from a known process that only runs occasionally,
you can filter out the unwanted results.

For example, to filter out results from a housekeeping process, named
`maintenanceservice.exe`, that only executes occasionally you need to:

. <<create-fiter-list>>
. <<add-job-filter>>
. <<clone-job, Clone and rerun the job>> (optional)

[[create-fiter-list]]
===== Create a filter list

. Go to *Machine Learning* -> *Anomaly Detection* -> *Settings*.
. Click *Filter Lists* and then *New*.
+
The *Create new filter list* pane is displayed.
. Enter a filter list ID.
. Enter a description for the filter list (optional).
. Click *Add item*.
. In the *Items* textbox, enter the name of the process for which you want to
filter out anomaly results (`maintenanceservice.exe` in our example).
+

. Click *Add* and then *Save*.
+
The new filter appears in the Filter List and can be added to relevant jobs.

[[add-job-filter]]
===== Add the filter to the relevant job

. Go to *Machine Learning* -> *Anomaly Detection* -> *Anomaly Explorer*.
. Navigate to the job results for which the filter is required. If the job results
are not listed, click *Edit job selection* and select the relevant job.
. In the *actions* column, click the gear icon and then select _Configure rules_.
+
The *Create Rule* window is displayed.
+

. Select:
.. _Add a filter list to limit where the rule applies_.
.. The _WHEN_ statement for the relevant detector (`process.name` in our
example).
.. The _IS IN_ statement.
.. The filter you created as part of the <<create-fiter-list>> procedure.
+
TIP: For more information about detectors, see
{ml-docs}/ml-jobs.html[Anomaly detection jobs].

. Click *Save*.

NOTE: Changes to rules only affect new results. All anomalies found by the job
before the filter was added are still displayed.

[[clone-job]]
===== Clone and rerun the job

If you want to remove all the previously detected results for the process, you
must clone and run the cloned job.

IMPORTANT: Running the cloned job can take some time. Only run the job after you
have completed all job rule changes.

. Go to *Machine Learning* -> *Anomaly Detection* -> *Job Management*.
. Navigate to the job for which you configured the rule.
. Optionally, expand the job row and click *JSON* to verify the configured filter
appears under `custom rules` in the JSON code.
. In the *actions* column, click the more (three dots) icon and select _Clone job_.
+
The *Configure datafeed* page is displayed.
. Click *Data Preview* and check the data is displayed without errors.
. Click *Next* until the *Job details* page is displayed.
. Enter a Job ID for the cloned job that indicates it is an iteration of the
original one. For example, append a number or a username to the original job
name, such as `windows-rare-network-process-2`.
+

. Click *Next* and check the job validates without errors. You can ignore
warnings about multiple influencers.
. Click *Next* and then *Create job*.
+
The *Start <job name>* window is displayed.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::start-job-window.png[]
. Select the point of time from which the job will analyze anomalies.
. Click *Start*.
+
After a while, results will start to appear on the *Anomaly Explorer* page.

[[define-rule-threshold]]
==== Define an anomaly threshold for a job

Certain jobs use a high-count function to look for unusual spikes in process
events. For some processes, a burst of activity is a normal, such as automation
and housekeeping jobs running on server fleets. However, sometimes a high-delta
event count is unlikely to be the result of routine behavior. In these cases,
you can define a minimum threshold for when a high-event count is considered an
anomaly.

Depending on your anomaly detection results, you may want to set a 
minimum event count threshold for the `packetbeat_dns_tunneling` job:


. Go to *Machine Learning* -> *Anomaly Detection* -> *Anomaly Explorer*.
. Navigate to the job results for the `packetbeat_dns_tunneling` job. If the 
job results are not listed, click *Edit job selection* and select 
`packetbeat_dns_tunneling`.
. In the *actions* column, click the gear icon and then select
_Configure rules_.
+
The *Create Rule* window is displayed.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::ml-rule-threshold.png[]
. Select _Add numeric conditions for when the rule applies_ and the following 
`when` statement:
+
_WHEN actual IS GREATER THAN <X>_
+
Where `<X>` is the threshold above which anomalies are detected.
. Click *Save*.
. To apply the new threshold, rerun the job (*Job Management* -> *Actions* ->
*Start datafeed*).
