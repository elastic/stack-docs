:description: You can import trained models into your cluster and configure them \
for specific NLP tasks.

If you want to perform {nlp} tasks in your cluster, you must deploy an
appropriate trained model. There is tooling support in
https://github.com/elastic/eland[Eland] and {kib} to help you prepare and manage
models.

[[ml-nlp-select-model]]
== Select a trained model

Per the <<ml-nlp-overview>>, there are multiple ways that you can use NLP
features within the {stack}. After you determine which type of NLP task you want
to perform, you must choose an appropriate trained model. 

The simplest method is to use a model that has already been fine-tuned for the
type of analysis that you want to perform. For example, there are models and
data sets available for specific NLP tasks on
https://huggingface.co/models[Hugging Face]. These instructions assume you're
using one of those models and do not describe how to create new models. For the
current list of supported model architectures, refer to <<ml-nlp-model-ref>>.

If you choose to perform language identification by using
the `lang_ident_model_1` that is provided in the cluster, no further steps are
required to import or deploy the model. You can skip to using the model in
<<ml-nlp-inference,ingestion pipelines>>.

[[ml-nlp-import-model]]
== Import the trained model and vocabulary

After you choose a model, you must import it and its tokenizer vocabulary to
your cluster. When you import the model, it must be chunked and imported one
chunk at a time for storage in parts due to its size.

NOTE: Trained models must be in a TorchScript representation for use with
{stack-ml-features}.

Eland encapsulates both the conversion of Hugging Face transformer models to
their TorchScript representations and the chunking process in a single Python
method; it is therefore the recommended import method.

. Install the {eland-docs}/installation.html[Eland Python client] with PyTorch 
extra dependencies.
+
--
[source,shell]
--------------------------------------------------
python -m pip install 'eland[pytorch]'
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
--

. Run the `eland_import_hub_model` script. For example:
+
--
[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
eland_import_hub_model <authentication> \ <1>
--hub-model-id elastic/distilbert-base-cased-finetuned-conll03-english \ <2>
--task-type ner \ <3>
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
--
<1> Use an authentication method to access your cluster. Refer to 
<<authentication>> to learn more. 
<2> Specify the identifier for the model in the Hugging Face model hub.
<3> Specify the type of NLP task. Supported values are `fill_mask`, `ner`,
`text_classification`, `text_embedding`, and `zero_shot_classification`.

For more details, refer to https://github.com/elastic/eland#nlp-with-pytorch.

[[authentication]]
=== Authentication methods

The following authentication options are available when using the import script:

* username/password authentication (specified with the `-u` and `-p` options):
  
[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
eland_import_hub_model --url https://<hostname>:<port> -u <username> -p <password>
--------------------------------------------------

* username/password authentication (embedded in the URL):

[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
eland_import_hub_model --url https://<user>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>
--------------------------------------------------

* Elastic Cloud users can use Cloud ID instead of the URL (`--url` 
  and `--cloud-id` are mutually exclusive):
  
[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
eland_import_hub_model --cloud-id <cloud-id> -u <username> -p <password>
--------------------------------------------------

* API key authentication:
  
[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
eland_import_hub_model --url https://<hostname>:<port> --es-api-key <api-key>
--------------------------------------------------

[[ml-nlp-deploy-model]]
== Deploy the model in your cluster

After you import the model and vocabulary, you can use {kib} to view and manage
their deployment across your cluster under **{ml-app}** > *Model Management*.
Alternatively, you can use the
{ref}/start-trained-model-deployment.html[start trained model deployment API] or
specify the `--start` option when you run the `eland_import_hub_model` script.

NOTE: Since eland uses APIs to deploy the models, you cannot see the models in
{kib} until the saved objects are synchronized. You can follow the prompts in
{kib}, wait for automatic synchronization, or use the
{kibana-ref}/machine-learning-api-sync.html[sync {ml} saved objects API].

When you deploy the model, it is allocated to all available {ml} nodes. The
model is loaded into memory in a native process that encapsulates `libtorch`,
which is the underlying machine learning library of PyTorch.

TIP: You can set additional deployment options that affect the performance of
the model. For example, specify the number of allocations and the threads per
allocation to optimize the throughput and speed of inference requests in your
production environment. For more information about these options, refer to the
{ref}/start-trained-model-deployment.html[start trained model deployment API].

You can view the allocation status in {kib} or by using the
{ref}/get-trained-models-stats.html[get trained model stats API].

[[ml-nlp-test-inference]]
== Try it out

When the model is deployed on at least one node in the cluster, you can begin to
perform inference. _{infer-cap}_ is a {ml} feature that enables you to use your
trained models to perform NLP tasks (such as text extraction, classification, or
embeddings) on incoming data.

The simplest method to test your model against new data is to use the
*Test model* action in {kib}:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-nlp-test-lang-ident.png[Testing a French phrase against the language identification trained model in the *{ml}* app]

NOTE: This {kib} functionality is currently available only for the
`lang_ident_model_1` model and for supported
<<ml-nlp-model-ref-ner,third party named entity recognition models>>.

Alternatively, you can use the
{ref}/infer-trained-model.html[infer trained model API].
For example, to try a named entity recognition task, provide some sample text:

//TBD: Test new API request and response
[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /_ml/trained_models/elastic__distilbert-base-cased-finetuned-conll03-english/_infer
{
  "docs":[{"text_field":"Sasha bought 300 shares of Acme Corp in 2022."}]
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]

In this example, the response contains the annotated text output and the
recognized entities:

[source,console-result]
----
{
  "predicted_value" : "[Sasha](ORG&Sasha) bought 300 shares of [Acme Corp](ORG&Acme+Corp) in 2022.",
  "entities" : [
    {
      "entity" : "sasha",
      "class_name" : "ORG",
      "class_probability" : 0.7618975251681134,
      "start_pos" : 0,
      "end_pos" : 5
    },
    {
      "entity" : "acme corp",
      "class_name" : "ORG",
      "class_probability" : 0.9986672643811757,
      "start_pos" : 27,
      "end_pos" : 36
    }
  ]
}
----
// NOTCONSOLE

If you are satisfied with the results, you can add these NLP tasks in your
<<ml-nlp-inference,ingestion pipelines>>.
