== Monitoring in a production environment

By default, monitoring agents store data in the cluster where they're running.
In production, you should
send data to a separate _monitoring cluster_ so that historical monitoring
data is available even when the nodes you are monitoring are not. If you are
sending your data to the ESMS, see <<esms>>.

In 6.4 and later, you can use {metricbeat} to ship monitoring data about 
{kib} to a separate monitoring cluster. In 6.5 and later, you can do the same 
for {es}. 

If you have at least a gold license, using a dedicated monitoring cluster also 
enables you to monitor multiple clusters from a central location.

To store monitoring data in a separate cluster:

. Set up the {es} cluster you want to use as the monitoring cluster. 
For example, you might set up a two host cluster with the nodes `es-mon-1` and 
`es-mon-2`.

[IMPORTANT]
===============================
* To monitor an {es} 7.x cluster, you must run {es}
7.x on the monitoring cluster.
* There must be at least one {ref}/ingest.html[ingest node] in the monitoring
cluster; it does not need to be a dedicated ingest node.
===============================
--

.. (Optional) Verify that the collection of monitoring data is disabled on the 
monitoring cluster. By default, the `xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` setting 
is `false`. 
+ 
--
For example, you can use the following APIs to review and change this setting:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
GET _cluster/settings

PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled": false
  }
}
----------------------------------
// CONSOLE
--

.. If the {es} {security-features} are enabled on the monitoring cluster, create 
users that can send and retrieve monitoring data. 
+
--
NOTE: If you plan to use {kib} to view monitoring data, username and password 
credentials must be valid on both the {kib} server and the monitoring cluster. 

--

*** If you plan to use {metricbeat} to collect data about {es} or {kib}, 
create a user that has the `remote_monitoring_collector` built-in role and a 
user that has the `remote_monitoring_agent` 
<<built-in-roles-remote-monitoring-agent,built-in role>>. Alternatively, use the 
`remote_monitoring_user` <<built-in-users,built-in user>>. 

*** If you plan to use HTTP exporters to route data through your production 
cluster, create a user that has the `remote_monitoring_agent` 
<<built-in-roles-remote-monitoring-agent,built-in role>>. 
+
--
For example, the 
following request creates a `remote_monitor` user that has the 
`remote_monitoring_agent` role:

[source, sh]
---------------------------------------------------------------
POST /_security/user/remote_monitor
{
  "password" : "changeme",
  "roles" : [ "remote_monitoring_agent"],
  "full_name" : "Internal Agent For Remote Monitoring"
}
---------------------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[skip:needs-gold+-license]

Alternatively, use the `remote_monitoring_user` <<built-in-users,built-in user>>. 
--

. Configure your production cluster to collect data and send it to the 
monitoring cluster. 

** {ref}/configuring-metricbeat.html[Use {metricbeat}]. This option 
is available in 6.5 and later versions. 

** {ref}/configuring-monitoring.html[Use HTTP exporters].

. (Optional)
{logstash-ref}/configuring-logstash.html[Configure {ls} to collect data and send it to the monitoring cluster]. 
+
--
NOTE: You must configure HTTP exporters in the production cluster to route this 
data to the monitoring cluster. It cannot be accomplished by using {metricbeat}. 

--

. (Optional) Configure {kib} to collect data and send it to the monitoring cluster:

** {kibana-ref}/monitoring-metricbeat.html[Use {metricbeat}]. This 
option is available in 6.4 and later versions. 

** {kibana-ref}/monitoring-kibana.html[Use HTTP exporters].

. (Optional) Create a dedicated {kib} instance for monitoring, rather than using 
a single {kib} instance to access both your production cluster and monitoring 
cluster.

.. (Optional) Disable the collection of monitoring data in this {kib} instance. 
Set the `xpack.monitoring.kibana.collection.enabled` setting to `false` in the 
`kibana.yml` file. For more information about this setting, see 
{kibana-ref}/monitoring-settings-kb.html[Monitoring settings in {kib}]. 

. {kibana-ref}/monitoring-data.html[Configure {kib} to retrieve and display the monitoring data].
