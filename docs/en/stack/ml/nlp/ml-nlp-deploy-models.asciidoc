If you want to perform {nlp} tasks in your cluster, you must deploy an
appropriate trained model. There is tooling support in
https://github.com/elastic/eland[Eland] and {kib} to help you prepare and manage
models.

[[ml-nlp-select-model]]
== Select a trained model

Per the <<ml-nlp-overview>>, there are multiple ways that you can use NLP
features within the {stack}. After you determine which type of NLP task you want
to perform, you must choose an appropriate trained model. 

The simplest method is to use a model that has already been fine-tuned for the
type of analysis that you want to perform. For example, there are models and
data sets available for specific NLP tasks on
https://huggingface.co/models[Hugging Face]. These instructions assume you're
using one of those models and do not describe how to create new models. For the
current list of supported model architectures, refer to <<ml-nlp-model-ref>>.

If you choose to perform {lang-ident} by using the `lang_ident_model_1` that is 
provided in the cluster, no further steps are required to import or deploy the 
model. You can skip to using the model in 
<<ml-nlp-inference,ingestion pipelines>>.

[[ml-nlp-import-model]]
== Import the trained model and vocabulary

After you choose a model, you must import it and its tokenizer vocabulary to
your cluster. When you import the model, it must be chunked and imported one
chunk at a time for storage in parts due to its size.

NOTE: Trained models must be in a TorchScript representation for use with
{stack-ml-features}.

Eland encapsulates both the conversion of Hugging Face transformer models to
their TorchScript representations and the chunking process in a single Python
method; it is therefore the recommended import method.

. Install the {eland-docs}/installation.html[Eland Python client] with PyTorch 
extra dependencies.
+
--
[source,shell]
--------------------------------------------------
python -m pip install 'eland[pytorch]'
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
--

. Run the `eland_import_hub_model` script. For example:
+
--
[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
eland_import_hub_model 
--cloud-id <cloud-id> \ <1>
-u <username> -p <password> \ <2>
--hub-model-id elastic/distilbert-base-cased-finetuned-conll03-english \ <3>
--task-type ner \ <4>
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
--
<1> Specify the Elastic Cloud identifier. Alternatively, use `--url`.
<2> Provide authentication details to access your cluster. Refer to 
<<authentication>> to learn more.
<3> Specify the identifier for the model in the Hugging Face model hub.
<4> Specify the type of NLP task. Supported values are `fill_mask`, `ner`,
`text_classification`, `text_embedding`, and `zero_shot_classification`.

For more details, refer to https://github.com/elastic/eland#nlp-with-pytorch.

[[authentication]]
=== Authentication methods

The following authentication options are available when using the import script:

* username/password authentication (specified with the `-u` and `-p` options):
+
--  
[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
eland_import_hub_model --url https://<hostname>:<port> -u <username> -p <password> ...
--------------------------------------------------
--

* username/password authentication (embedded in the URL):
+
--
[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
eland_import_hub_model --url https://<user>:<password>@<hostname>:<port> ...
--------------------------------------------------
--
* API key authentication:
+
--
[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------
eland_import_hub_model --url https://<hostname>:<port> --es-api-key <api-key> ...

[[ml-nlp-deploy-model]]
== Deploy the model in your cluster

After you import the model and vocabulary, you can use {kib} to view and manage
their deployment across your cluster under **{ml-app}** > *Model Management*.
Alternatively, you can use the
{ref}/start-trained-model-deployment.html[start trained model deployment API] or
specify the `--start` option when you run the `eland_import_hub_model` script.

NOTE: Since eland uses APIs to deploy the models, you cannot see the models in
{kib} until the saved objects are synchronized. You can follow the prompts in
{kib}, wait for automatic synchronization, or use the
{kibana-ref}/machine-learning-api-sync.html[sync {ml} saved objects API].

When you deploy the model, its allocations are distributed across available {ml} 
nodes. Model allocations are independent units of work for NLP tasks. Throughput 
can be scaled by adding more allocations to the deployment; it increases the 
number of {infer} requests that can be performed in parallel. All allocations 
assigned to a node share the same copy of the model in memory. The model is 
loaded into memory in a native process that encapsulates `libtorch`, which is 
the underlying {ml} library of PyTorch.

You can set the number of allocations and the number of threads an allocation 
uses for your deployment to affect model performance.

The number of allocations setting affects the amount of model allocations across 
all the {ml} nodes. Increasing the number of allocations generally increases the 
throughput. Model allocations are distributed in such a way that the total 
number of used threads does not exceed the allocated processors of a node.

The threads per allocation setting affects the number of threads used by each 
model allocation during {infer}. Increasing the number of threads generally 
increases the speed of {infer} requests. The value of this setting must not 
exceed the number of available allocated processors per node.

You can view the allocation status in {kib} or by using the
{ref}/get-trained-models-stats.html[get trained model stats API].

[discrete]
[[ml-nlp-test-inference]]
== Try it out

When the model is deployed on at least one node in the cluster, you can begin to
perform inference. _{infer-cap}_ is a {ml} feature that enables you to use your
trained models to perform NLP tasks (such as text extraction, classification, or
embeddings) on incoming data.

The simplest method to test your model against new data is to use the
*Test model* action in {kib}:

image::images/ml-nlp-test-lang-ident.png[Testing a French phrase against the language identification trained model in the *{ml}* app]

Alternatively, you can use the
{ref}/infer-trained-model.html[infer trained model API].
For example, to try a named entity recognition task, provide some sample text:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /_ml/trained_models/elastic__distilbert-base-cased-finetuned-conll03-english/_infer
{
  "docs":[{"text_field": "Sasha bought 300 shares of Acme Corp in 2022."}]
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]

In this example, the response contains the annotated text output and the
recognized entities:

[source,console-result]
----
{
  "inference_results" : [
    {
      "predicted_value" : "[Sasha](PER&Sasha) bought 300 shares of [Acme Corp](ORG&Acme+Corp) in 2022.",
      "entities" : [
        {
          "entity" : "Sasha",
          "class_name" : "PER",
          "class_probability" : 0.9953193407987492,
          "start_pos" : 0,
          "end_pos" : 5
        },
        {
          "entity" : "Acme Corp",
          "class_name" : "ORG",
          "class_probability" : 0.9996392198381716,
          "start_pos" : 27,
          "end_pos" : 36
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
// NOTCONSOLE

If you are satisfied with the results, you can add these NLP tasks in your
<<ml-nlp-inference,ingestion pipelines>>.
