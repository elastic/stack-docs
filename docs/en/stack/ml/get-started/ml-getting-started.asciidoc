[[ml-getting-started]]
== Getting started with {ml}

Ready to take {ml} for a test drive? Follow this tutorial to:

* Try out the **{data-viz}**
* Create {anomaly-jobs} for the {kib} sample data
* Use the results to identify possible anomalies in the data

At the end of this tutorial, you should have a good idea of what {ml} is and
will hopefully be inspired to use it to detect anomalies in your own data.

Need more context? Check out the
{ref}/elasticsearch-intro.html[{es} introduction] to learn the lingo and
understand the basics of how {es} works.

[TIP]
==========
You can run {es} and {kib} on your own hardware, or use our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud}.
The {ess} is available on both AWS and GCP.
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup[Try out the {ess} for free].

. Verify that your environment is set up properly to use the {ml-features}. If
the {es} {security-features} are enabled, to complete this tutorial you need a
user that has authority to manage {anomaly-jobs}. See <<setup>>.

. {kibana-ref}/add-sample-data.html[Add the sample data sets that ship with {kib}]. 

.. Click the {kib} logo in the upper left hand corner of your browser to navigate
to the {kib} home page.

.. Click *Load a data set and a Kibana dashboard*.

.. Pick a data set. In this tutorial, you'll use the *Sample web logs*. While
you're here, feel free to click *Add* on all of the available sample data sets.

These data sets are now ready be analyzed in {ml} jobs in {kib}.
