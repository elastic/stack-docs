== Managing signal detection rules

beta[]

Rules run periodically and search for documents or {ml} job anomaly scores 
that meet their criteria.

[IMPORTANT]
==============
After you activate a rule, periodically check the rule is running as expected
in the <<monitor-rule-exe, Monitoring tab>> on the All rules page. If you see
values in the `Gap` column, you can <<troubleshoot-signals>>.

When a rule fails to run, the {siem-app} tries to rerun it at its next 
scheduled run time.
==============

On the Rules page, you can:

* <<load-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<select-all-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<create-rule-ui, Create your own rules>>
* <<manage-rules-ui, Clone, edit, delete, activate, and deactivate rules>>
* <<monitor-rule-exe>>
* <<import-export-rules-ui>>
* <<troubleshoot-signals>>

[[load-prebuilt-rules]]
=== Load prebuilt Elastic rules

To load the {siem-app}'s <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>, click
*Load Elastic prebuilt rules* on the *Signal detection rules* page (*SIEM* -> 
*Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*).

If you delete any of the prebuilt rules, a button appears that enables 
reloading all the deleted prebuilt rules.

[NOTE]
==============
By default, prebuilt rules are not activated. If you want to modify a prebuilt 
rule, you must first duplicate it and then make your changes to the duplicated 
rule. <<filter-rule-process>> provides a detailed example of duplicating and modifying a rule.

All Elastic prebuilt rules are tagged with the word `Elastic`.
==============

[float]
[[select-all-prebuilt-rules]]
=== Select and duplicate all prebuilt rules

. Select the *Elastic rules* tab.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
. Click the `Rows per page` menu, and then select _200 rows_.
. When the page reloads, select all the rules.
. Click _Bulk actions_ -> _Duplicate selected_.
. Select the *Custom rules* tab.

You can then modify the duplicated rules and, if required, delete the prebuilt 
ones.

[float]
[[create-rule-ui]]
=== Create a new rule

You can create two types of rules:

* *Custom query*: Query-based rule, which searches the defined indices and creates a signal when a document matches the rule's query.
* *Machine learning*: {ml-cap} rule, which creates a signal when a {ml} job discovers an anomaly above the defined threshold (see <<machine-learning>>).
+
For {ml} rules, the associated {ml} job must be running. If the {ml} job is not
running, the rule will:

** Run and create signals if existing anomaly scores above the defined threshold
are discovered.
** Issue an error stating the {ml} job was not running when the rule executed.

IMPORTANT: To create {ml} rules, you must have the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] or use a
{ess-trial}[cloud deployment].

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*.
. Click *Create new rule*.
+
The *Create new rule* page is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/create-new-rule.png[]
. Do *one* of the following:
* To create a rule based on a {ml} anomaly threshold, select _Machine Learning_
and then:
.. The required {ml} job.
.. The anomaly score threshold above which signals are created.
+
IMPORTANT: The selected {ml} job must be running for the rule to function
correctly.

* To create a rule based on a KQL or Lucene query, select _Custom query_ and
then:
.. Define which {es} indices the rule analyzes for signals.
.. Use the filter and query fields to create the criteria used for detecting 
signals.
+
NOTE: You can use {kib} saved queries (save icon) and queries from saved timelines (`Import query from saved timeline`) as rule conditions.
+
For example, the following rule detects when the `vssadmin delete shadows`
Windows command is executed:

** _Index patterns_: `winlogbeat-*`
+
Winlogbeat ships Windows event logs to the SIEM app.
** _Custom query_: `event.action:"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)" and process.name:"vssadmin.exe" and process.args:("delete" and "shadows")`
+
Searches the `winlogbeat-*` indices for `vssadmin.exe` executions with 
the `delete` and `shadow` arguments, which are used to delete a volume's shadow
copies.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::rule-query-example.png[]
+
TIP: This example is based on the
<<volume-shadow-copy-deletion-via-vssadmin, Volume Shadow Copy Deletion via VssAdmin>> prebuilt rule.

. Select the timeline template used when you investigate a signal created by
the rule in Timeline (optional).
+
TIP: Before you create rules, create and save relevant
<<timelines-ui,timelines>> so they can be selected here. When signals generated
by the rule are investigated in Timeline,
<<signals-to-timelines, some query field values>> are replaced with their
corresponding signal field values.

. Click *Continue*.
+
The *About rule* pane is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/about-rule-pane.png[]
. Fill in the following fields:
.. _Name_: The rule's name.
.. _Description_: A description of what the rule does.
.. _Severity_: Select the severity levels of signals created by the rule:
* `Low`: Signals that are of interest but generally not considered to be 
security incidents. Sometimes, a combination of low severity events can 
indicate suspicious activity.
* `Medium`: Signals that require investigation.
* `High`: Signals that require an immediate investigation.
* `Critical`: Signals that indicate it is highly likely a security incident has 
 occurred.
.. _Risk score_: A numerical value between 0 and 100 that correlates with the _Severity_ level. General guidelines are:
* `0` - `21` represents low severity.
* `22` - `47` represents medium severity.
* `48` - `73` represents high severity.
* `74` - `100` represents critical severity.
.. For additional options, click *Advanced settings* and fill in any of 
these fields:
... _Reference URLs_ (optional): References to information that is relevant to 
the rule. For example, links to relevant background information.
... _False positives_ (optional): List of common scenarios that may produce 
false-positive signals.
... _MITRE ATT&CK^TM^_ (optional): Relevant MITRE framework tactics and techniques.
... _Tags_ (optional): Words and phrases used to categorize, filter, and search 
the rule.
... _Investigation guide_ (optional): Information for analysts investigating
signals created by the rule.
. Click *Continue*.
+
[[rule-schedule]]
The *Schedule rule* pane is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/schedule-rule.png[]
. Select how often the rule runs.
. Optionally, add `Additional look-back time` to the rule. When defined, the 
rule searches indices with the additional time.
+
For example, if you set a rule to run every 5 minutes with an additional
look-back time of 1 minute, the rule runs every 5 minutes but analyses the 
documents added to indices during the last 6 minutes.
+
[IMPORTANT]
==============
It is recommended to set the `Additional look-back time` to at 
least 1 minute. This ensures there are no missing signals when a rule does not 
run exactly at its scheduled time.

The {siem-app} performs deduplication. Duplicate signals discovered during the 
`Additional look-back time` are *not* created.
==============
. Click *Continue*.
+
[[rule-actions]]
The *Rule actions* pane is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-actions.png[]
. Optionally, use {kib} Alerting to set up notifications sent via other systems
when new signals are detected.
+
NOTE: To use {kib} Alerting for signal notifications, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

.. Set how often notifications are sent:

* _On each rule execution_: Sends a notification every time new signals are
detected.
* _Hourly_: Sends a notification every hour.
* _Daily_: Sends a notification every day.
* _Weekly_: Sends a notification every week.
+
NOTE: Notifications are sent only when new signals are detected.

+
The available action types are displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/available-action-types.png[]

+
.. Select the required action type, which determines how notifications are sent (Email, PagerDuty, Slack, Webhook).
+
NOTE: Each action type requires a connector. Connectors store the
information required to send the notification from the external system. You can
configure connectors while creating the rule or on the {kib} Alerts and Actions
page (*Management* -> *Alerts and Actions* -> *Connectors*). For more
information, see {kibana-ref}/action-types.html[Action and connector types].

+
The selected action type fields are displayed (Slack example).
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/selected-action-type.png[]

+
.. Fill in the fields for the selected action types. For all action types, click
the icon above the `Message` field to add placeholders for rule and signal
details to the notifications. 

. Save the rule with or without activation.
+
NOTE: When you activate a rule, it is queued and its schedule is determined by 
its initial run time. For example, if you activate a rule that runs every 5 
minutes at 14:03 but it does not run until 14:04, it will run again at 14:09.

[float]
[[manage-rules-ui]]
=== Modify existing rules

You can clone, edit, activate, deactivate, and delete rules:

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*.
. Do one of the following:
* Click the actions icon (three dots) and then select the required action.
* In the *Rule* column, select all the rules you want to modify, and then the 
required action from the `Bulk actions` menu.
. To activate or deactivate a rule, click the Activate toggle button.

NOTE: For prebuilt rules, you can only activate, deactivate, delete, and edit
<<rule-actions, rule actions>>.

[float]
[[monitor-rule-exe]]
=== Monitor all rule executions

To view a summary of all rule executions, such as failures and last execution
times, click the Monitoring tab in the *All rules* table (*SIEM* ->
*Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*).

For detailed information on a rule, its produced signals, and errors, click on
a rule name in the *All rules* table.

[float]
[[import-export-rules-ui]]
=== Import and export rules

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*.
. To import rules:
.. Click *Import rule*.
.. Drag-and-drop files containing the signal detection rules.
+
NOTE: Imported rules must be in an `ndjson` file.

. To export rules:
.. In the *All rules* table, select the rules you want to export.
.. Select *Bulk actions* -> *Export selected*.
+
NOTE: You cannot export prebuilt rules.

[float]
[[troubleshoot-signals]]
=== Troubleshoot missing signals

When a rule fails to run close to its scheduled time, some signals may be 
missing. There are a number of steps you can perform to try and resolve this 
issue.

If you see `Gaps` in the All rules table or on the Rule details page
for a small number of rules, you can increase those rules'
`Additional look-back time` (*Signal detection rules* page -> the rule's
actions icon -> *Edit rule settings* -> *Schedule* -> _Additional look-back time_).

If you see gaps for a lot of rules:

* If you restarted {kib} when many rules were activated, try deactivating them 
and then reactivating them in small batches at staggered intervals. This 
ensures {kib} does not attempt to run all the rules at the same time.
* Consider adding another {kib} instance to your environment.
