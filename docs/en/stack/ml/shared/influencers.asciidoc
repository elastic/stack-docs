When you create an {anomaly-job}, you can identify fields as _influencers_.
These are fields that you think contain information about someone or something
that influences or contributes to anomalies.

As a best practice, do not pick too many influencers. For example, you generally
do not need more than three. If you pick many influencers, the results can be
overwhelming and there is a small overhead to the analysis. For more details,
see <<ml-influencers>>.
