== How monitoring works

Monitoring collects data from {es} nodes, Logstash nodes, and {kib} instances.
The {es} cluster you are monitoring controls where the monitoring metrics for
the entire stack are stored. By default, they are stored in local indices.

TIP: In production, we strongly recommend using a separate monitoring
Elasticsearch cluster. Using a separate monitoring cluster
prevents production cluster outages from impacting your ability to access your
monitoring data. It also prevents monitoring activities from impacting the
performance of your production cluster. For the same reason, we also
recommend to use a separate Kibana instance that is connected to the separate
monitoring cluster.

IMPORTANT: In general, the monitoring cluster and the clusters being monitored
should be running the same version of the stack. A monitoring cluster cannot
monitor production clusters running newer versions of the stack. If necessary,
the monitoring cluster can monitor production clusters running older versions,
but the versions cannot differ by more than one major version.

The following diagram illustrates a typical monitoring architecture with
separate production and monitoring clusters:

If you have at least a Gold license, you can route data from multiple production
clusters to a single monitoring cluster:

If {kib} is a regular part of your stack, you might want to create a dedicated
{kib} instance for monitoring, rather than using a single {kib} instance to
access both your production cluster and monitoring cluster:
