These {anomaly-jobs} automatically detect file system and network anomalies on
your hosts. They appear in the *Anomaly Detection* interface of the
{security-app} in {kib} when you have data that matches their configuration.

[[security-authentication]]
== Security: Authentication

Detect anomalous activity in your ECS-compatible authentication logs.

In the {ml-app} app, these configurations are available only when data exists
that matches the query specified in the
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/{branch}/x-pack/plugins/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_auth/manifest.json[manifest file].
In the {security-app}, it looks in the {data-source} specified in the
{kibana-ref}/advanced-options.html#securitysolution-defaultindex[`securitySolution:defaultIndex` advanced setting]
for data that matches the query.

By default, when you create these job in the {security-app}, it uses a
{data-source} that applies to multiple indices. To get the same results if you
use the {ml-app} app, create a similar 
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/{branch}/x-pack/plugins/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_auth/manifest.json#L7[{data-source}]
then select it in the job wizard.

|Looks for a user logging in at a time of day that is unusual for the user. This can be due to credentialed access via a compromised account when the user and the threat actor are in different time zones. In addition, unauthorized user activity often takes place during non-business hours.

|auth_rare_source_ip_for_a_user
|Looks for a user logging in from an IP address that is unusual for the user. This can be due to credentialed access via a compromised account when the user and the threat actor are in different locations. An unusual source IP address for a username could also be due to lateral movement when a compromised account is used to pivot between hosts.

|auth_rare_user
|Looks for an unusual user name in the authentication logs. An unusual user name is one way of detecting credentialed access by means of a new or dormant user account. A user account that is normally inactive, because the user has left the organization, which becomes active, may be due to credentialed access using a compromised account password. Threat actors will sometimes also create new users as a means of persisting in a compromised web application.

|high_count_by_destination_country

Data exfiltration activity may also produce such a surge in traffic to a destination country which does not normally appear in network traffic or business work-flows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms may communicate with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an unusual destination country for the source network.

|high_count_network_denies
|Looks for an unusually large spike in network traffic that was denied by network ACLs or firewall rules. Such a burst of denied traffic is usually either 1) a misconfigured application or firewall or 2) suspicious or malicious activity. Unsuccessful attempts at network transit, in order to connect to command-and-control (C2), or engage in data exfiltration, may produce a burst of failed connections. This could also be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic.  Denial-of-service attacks or traffic floods may also produce such a surge in traffic.

[[security-windows-jobs]]
== Security: Windows

Anomaly detection jobs for Windows host-based threat hunting and detection.

In the {ml-app} app, these configurations are available only when data exists
that matches the query specified in the
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/{branch}/x-pack/plugins/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_windows/manifest.json[manifest file].
In the {security-app}, it looks in the {data-source} specified in the
{kibana-ref}/advanced-options.html#securitysolution-defaultindex[`securitySolution:defaultIndex` advanced setting]
for data that matches the query.

If there are additional requirements such as installing the Windows System
Monitor (Sysmon) or auditing process creation in the Windows security event log,
they are listed for each job.
