=== Process Activity via Compiled HTML File

Compiled HTML files (`.chm`) are commonly distributed as part of the Microsoft
HTML Help system. Adversaries may conceal malicious code in a CHM file and
deliver it to a victim for execution. CHM content is loaded by the HTML Help
executable program (`hh.exe`).

==== Potential false positives

The HTML Help executable program (`hh.exe`) runs whenever a user clicks a 
compiled help (`.chm`) file or menu item that opens the help file inside the 
Help Viewer. This is not always malicious, but adversaries may abuse this 
technology to conceal malicious code.
