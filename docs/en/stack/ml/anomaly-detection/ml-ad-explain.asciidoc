:description: An explanation of how the anomaly score is calculated for \
{ml} {anomaly-detect}.

Every anomaly has an anomaly score assigned to it. That score indicates how 
anomalous the data point is, which makes it possible to define its severity 
compared to other anomalies. This page gives you a high-level explanation of the 
critical factors considered for calculating anomaly scores, how the scores 
are calculated, and how renormalization works.

[[score-impact-factors]]
== Anomaly score impact factors

Three factors can affect the initial anomaly score of a record: 

* single bucket impact,
* multi-bucket impact,
* anomaly characteristics impact.

{anomaly-jobs-cap} split the time series data into time buckets. The data within 
a bucket is aggregated using functions. Anomaly detection is happening on the 
bucket values.

[[single-bucket-impact]]
=== Single bucket impact

The probability of the actual value in the bucket is calculated first. This 
probability depends on how many similar values were seen in the past. It often 
relates to the difference between actual and typical values. The typical value 
is the median value of the probability distribution for the bucket. This 
probability leads to the single bucket impact. It usually dominates the initial 
anomaly score of a short spike or dip.

[discrete]
[[multi-bucket-impact]]
=== Multi-bucket impact

The probabilities of the values in the current bucket and the preceding 11 
buckets consist of the multi-bucket impact. The accumulated differences between 
the actual and typical values result in the multi-bucket impact on the initial 
anomaly score of the current bucket. High multi-bucket impact indicates unusual 
behavior in the interval preceding the current bucket, even if the value of this  
bucket may be within the 95% confidence interval.

Different signs mark the anomalies with high multi-bucket impact to highlight 
the distinction. A cross sign "+" represents these anomalies in {kib}, instead 
of a circle.


[discrete]
[[anomaly-characteristics-impact]]
=== Anomaly characteristics impact

The impact of the anomaly characteristics considers the different features of 
the anomaly, such as its length and size. The total duration of the anomaly is 
considered, and not a fixed interval as in the case of the multi-bucket impact 
calculation. The length might be only one bucket or thirty, but even more. 
Comparing the length and size of the anomaly to the historical averages makes it 
possible to adapt to your domain and the patterns in data. The default behavior 
of the algorithm is to score longer anomalies higher than short-lived spikes. In 
practice, short anomalies often turn out to be errors in data, while long 
anomalies are something you might need to react to.

Combining multi-bucket impact and anomaly characteristics impact leads to more 
reliable detection of abnormal behavior over various domains.

[[record-score-reduction]]
== Record score reduction (renormalization)

Anomaly scores are in the range of 0 and 100. The values close to 100 signify 
the biggest anomalies the job has seen to date. For this reason, when an anomaly 
bigger than any other before is detected, the scores of previous anomalies need 
to be reduced. 

The process when the anomaly detection algorithm adjusts the anomaly scores of 
past records when new data comes in is called _renormalization_. The 
`renormalization_window_days` configuration parameter specifies the time 
interval for this adjustment. The **Single Metric Viewer** in Kibana highlights 
the renormalization change.

[[other-factors]]
== Other factors for score reduction

Two more factors may lead to a reduction of the initial score: high variance 
interval and incomplete bucket. 

{anomaly-detect-cap} is less reliable if the current bucket is part of a 
seasonal pattern with high variability in data. For example, you may have server 
maintenance jobs running every night at midnight. These jobs can lead to high 
variability in the latency of request processing. The job is also more reliable 
if the current bucket has received a similar number of observations as 
historically expected.

Real-world anomalies often show the impacts of several factors. The 
**Anomaly explanation** section in the Single Metric Viewer can help you 
interpret an anomaly in its context.
