=== Influencers

When anomalous events occur, we want to know why. To determine the cause,
however, you often need a broader knowledge of the domain. If you have
suspicions about which entities in your dataset are likely causing
irregularities, you can identify them as influencers in your {anomaly-jobs}.
That is to say, _influencers_ are fields that you suspect contain information
about someone or something that influences or contributes to anomalies in your
data.

Influencers can be any field in your data. If you use {dfeeds}, however, the
field must exist in your {dfeed} query or aggregation; otherwise it is not
included in the job analysis. If you use a query in your {dfeed}, there is an
additional requirement: influencer fields must exist in the query results in the
same hit as the detector fields. {dfeeds-cap} process data by paging through the
query results; since search hits cannot span multiple indices or documents,
{dfeeds} have the same limitation. 

Influencers do not need to be fields that are specified in your {anomaly-job}
detectors, though they often are. If you use aggregations in your {dfeed}, it is
possible to use influencers that come from different indices than the detector
fields. However, both indices must have a date field with the same name, which you
specify in the `data_description`.`time_field` property for the {dfeed}.

Picking an influencer is strongly recommended for the following reasons:

* It allows you to more easily assign blame for anomalies
* It simplifies and aggregates the results

If you use {kib}, the job creation wizards can suggest which fields to use as
influencers. The best influencer is the person or thing that you want to blame
for the anomaly. In many cases, users or client IP addresses make excellent
influencers.

TIP: As a best practice, do not pick too many influencers. For example, you
generally do not need more than three. If you pick many influencers, the results
can be overwhelming and there is a small overhead to the analysis.

[[ml-influencer-results]]
==== Influencer results

The influencer results show which entities were anomalous and when. One
influencer result is written per bucket for each influencer that is considered
anomalous. For jobs with more than one detector, these scores provide a powerful
view of the most anomalous entities.

For example, the `high_sum_total_sales` {anomaly-job} for the eCommerce orders
sample data uses `customer_full_name.keyword` and `category.keyword` as
influencers. You can examine the influencer results with the
{ref}/ml-get-influencer.html[get influencers API]. Alternatively, you can use
the *Anomaly Explorer* in {kib}:

On the left is a list of the top influencers for all of the detected anomalies
in that same time period. The list includes maximum anomaly scores, which in
this case are aggregated for each influencer, for each bucket, across all
detectors. There is also a total sum of the anomaly scores for each influencer.
You can use this list to help you narrow down the contributing factors and focus
on the most anomalous entities.

You can also explore swim lanes that correspond to the values of an influencer.
In this example, the swim lanes correspond to the values for the 
`customer_full_name.keyword`. By default, the swim lanes are sorted according to
which entity has the maximum anomaly score values. You can click on the sections
in the swim lane to see details about the anomalies that occurred in that time
interval.

TIP: The anomaly scores that you see in each section of the *Anomaly Explorer*
might differ slightly. This disparity occurs because for each {anomaly-job},
there are bucket results, influencer results, and record results. Anomaly scores
are generated for each type of result. The anomaly timeline in {kib} uses the
bucket-level anomaly scores. If you view swim lanes by influencer, it uses the
influencer-level anomaly scores, as does the list of top influencers. The list
of anomalies uses the record-level anomaly scores.
