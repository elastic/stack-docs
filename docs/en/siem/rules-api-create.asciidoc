[[rules-api-create]]
=== Create rule

Creates a new signal detection rule.

You can create two types of rules:

* Query-based rules, which search the defined indices and creates a signal when
a document matches the rule's query.
* {ml-cap} rules, which create a signal when a {ml} job discovers an anomaly above the defined threshold (see <<machine-learning>>).

IMPORTANT: To create {ml} rules, you must have the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] or use a
{ess-trial}[cloud deployment]. Additionally, for the {ml} rule to function
correctly, the associated {ml} job must be running.

To retrieve {ml} job IDs, which are required to create {ml} jobs, call the
{ref}/ml-get-job.html[{es} Get jobs API]. {ml-cap} jobs that contain `siem` in
the `groups` field can be used to create rules:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
...
"job_id": "linux_anomalous_network_activity_ecs",
"job_type": "anomaly_detector",
"job_version": "7.7.0",
"groups": [
  "auditbeat",
  "process",
  "siem"
],
...
--------------------------------------------------

Additionally, you can set up notifications for when rules create signals. The
notifications use the {kib} {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting and Actions framework].
Each action type requires a connector. Connectors store the information
required to send notifications via external systems. These action types are
supported for rule notifications:

* Slack
* email
* PagerDuty
* Webhook

NOTE: For more information on PagerDuty fields, see https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/v2/docs/send-an-event-events-api-v2[PagerDuty Send a v2 Event API]. 

To retrieve connector IDs, which are required to configure rule notifications,
call `GET <kibana host>:<port>/api/action/_find`.

For detailed information on {kib} actions and alerting, and additional API
calls, see:

* https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/x-pack/plugins/alerting

If the rule starts to run at 15:00, it analyzes data from 13:50 until 15:00.
