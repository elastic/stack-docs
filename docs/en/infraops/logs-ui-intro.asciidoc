beta[]

The {logs-ui} UI provides real-time log tailing in a compact, customizable
display. The log data is correlated with metrics in the
<<infrastructure-ui-overview,{infra-ui} UI>>, making it easier for you to diagnose
problems. You can stream the logs in real time, or load the new data manually.
Logs are streamed from top to bottom, making it easier for you to explore the
logs in real time and see a historical view of your log data. The search bar in
the log viewer supports {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language].
You can enter ad hoc or structured queries.
