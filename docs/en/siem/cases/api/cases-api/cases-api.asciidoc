== Cases API

beta[]

You can create, manage, configure, and send cases to external systems with
these APIs:

* Cases API: Used to open and manage security action items.

* Actions API: Used to send cases to external systems. <<register-connector>>
stores the data required to interface with third-party systems, and
<<cases-actions-api-execute>> sends {siem-soln} cases to external systems
(currently, {sn}).
