== Metrics monitoring overview

The {metrics-app} enables you to monitor metrics for your infrastructure and identify problems in real time.
You can view basic metrics for servers, containers, services, and so on.
Then you can drill down to view more detailed metrics, or you can seamlessly switch to view corresponding logs, uptime information or APM traces where available.
// Add links to logs, uptime and APM when I have good places to link to.

=== Metrics monitoring components

// redo for metrics and logs separately.

Metrics monitoring requires the following {stack} components.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[{es}]* is a real-time,
distributed storage, search, and analytics engine. {es} can store, search, and analyze large volumes of data in near real-time.
The {metrics-app} uses {es} to store metrics data in {es} documents which are queried on demand.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[{beats}]* are open source data shippers that you install as agents on your servers to send data to {es}.
The {metrics-app} uses metrics collected by Metricbeat from the servers, containers, and other services in your infrastructure.
Metricbeat modules are available for most common servers, containers and services.

*https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[{kib}]* is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with {es}.
You use {kib} to search, view, and interact with the metrics data stored in {es}.
You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables,
and maps.
The <<infrastructure-ui-overview, {metrics-app}>> in {kib} provides a dedicated user interface to view metrics for your infrastructure.
