== Getting started with {ml}

Ready to take {ml} for a test drive? Follow this tutorial to:

* Try out the **{data-viz}**
* Create {anomaly-jobs} for the {kib} sample data
* Use the results to identify possible anomalies in the data

At the end of this tutorial, you should have a good idea of what {ml} is and
will hopefully be inspired to use it to detect anomalies in your own data.

Need more context? Check out the
{ref}/elasticsearch-intro.html[{es} introduction] to learn the lingo and
understand the basics of how {es} works.
