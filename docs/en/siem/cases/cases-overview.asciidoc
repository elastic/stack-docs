= Cases (Beta)

beta[]

Cases are used to open and track security issues directly in the {siem-app}. 
All cases list the original reporter and all users who contribute to a case
(`participants`). Comments support Markdown syntax, and allow linking to saved
<<timelines-overview, Timelines>>. Additionally, you can send cases to external
systems from within the {siem-app} (currently {sn}). <<cases-ui-integrations>>
describes how to set this up.

You can create and manage cases via the UI or the <<cases-api-overview>>.

NOTE: To send cases to {sn}, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

IMPORTANT: To make sure you can view and open cases, see <<case-permisions>>.
