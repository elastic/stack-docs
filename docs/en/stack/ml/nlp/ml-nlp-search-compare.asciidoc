== Text embedding

Text embedding is a task which produces a mathematical representation of a text 
called embedding. The {ml} model turns the text into an array of numerical 
values (a vector). Pieces of content with similar meaning have similar 
representation. This means it is possible to determine whether different pieces 
of text are either semantically similar, different, or even opposite by using a 
mathematical similarity function.

This task is only responsible for producing the embedding alone. When the 
embedding is created, it can be stored in a `dense_vector` field and used at 
search time. Then you can apply the similarity function to an embedding 
representing a query, and create a semantic search capability.

The following is an example of producing a text embedding:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
...
{
    "input": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
}
...
----------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE


The task returns the following result:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
...
{
    "results": [0.293478, -0.23845, ..., 1.34589e2, 0.119376]
}
...
