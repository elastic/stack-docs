= Reverting to a model snapshot

{ml-docs}/ml-ad-run-jobs.html#ml-ad-model-snapshots[Snapshots of the {ml} model] 
for each {anomaly-job} are saved frequently to an internal {es} index to ensure 
resilience. It makes it possible to reset the model to a previous state in case 
of a system failure or if the model changed significantly due to a one-off 
event.

. In {kib}, navigate to *Jobs*. To open *Jobs*, find **{ml-app} > Anomaly Detection** in the main menu, or use the {kibana-ref}/kibana-concepts-analysts.html#_finding_your_apps_and_objects[global search field].
. Locate the {anomaly-job} whose model you want to revert in the job table.
. Open the job details and navigate to the **Model Snapshots** tab.

. Select a snapshot from the list and click the **Revert** icon under 
  **Actions**.
. Optional: Select if you want to replay the analysis based on the data in your 
  index after the revert has been applied. If you donâ€™t select this option, 
  there will be no {anomaly-detect} results after the snapshot was taken and the 
  job results end at the point in time of the snapshot. If you select this 
  option, you can then optionally select one or both of the next two options:

  * You can select whether you want the job to continue running in real time 
  after the replay, or to just replay existing data after the snapshot.
  * You can select a time range you want to avoid during the replay by declaring 
  a calendar event. This way, you can skip any problematic time frame that you 
  want the {anomaly-job} to avoid.

. Click **Apply**.

TIP: You can use <<ml-ad-rules,custom rules>> to avoid a model being updated in 
  case of a known event you want to exclude from the analysis. Using custom 
  rules might help you to avoid situations where you need to revert to a 
  snapshot.

Alternatively, you can use the 
{ref}/ml-revert-snapshot.html[revert model snapshots] API. In this case, you 
need to manually close the corresponding job before reverting to the saved 
snapshot.

[NOTE]
===============================
* By default, when you revert to a snapshot, all {anomaly-detect} results are deleted 
  for the corresponding job after the point when the snapshot was saved. If you 
  replay the analysis, results will be re-generated based on your configuration.
* Reverting to a snapshot does not change the `data_counts` values of the 
  {anomaly-job}, these values are not reverted to the earlier state.
