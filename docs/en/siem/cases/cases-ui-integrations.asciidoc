== Configuring external connections

You can push new cases and case updates to {sn} and Jira. To do this, you need
to create a connector, which stores the information required to push cases to
external systems. For {sn}, cases are send via {sn}'s
https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/madrid/rest/c_TableAPI[Table API]. For Jira, the
https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/[REST API v2] is
used.

After you have created a connector, you can set {siem-soln} cases to
automatically close when they are sent to external systems.

NOTE: To create connectors and send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

=== Create a new connector

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Cases* -> *Edit external connection*.

image::images/cases-ui-connector.png[]
. From the `Incident management system` list, select `Add new connector`.
. Select one of these:
* {sn}: To send cases to {sn}.
* Jira: To send cases to Jira.

. Fill in the following:
* _Connector name_: A name for the connector.
* _URL_: The URL of the external system to which you want to send cases.
* _Username_ ({sn} connectors only): The username of the {sn} account used to
access the {sn} instance.
* _Password_ ({sn} connectors only): The password of the {sn} account used to access the {sn} instance.
* _Project key_ (Jira connectors only): The key of the Jira project to which
you are sending cases.
* _Email_ (Jira connectors only): The Jira account's email address.
* _API token_ (Jira connectors only): The API token used to authenticate Jira
updates.

. Save the connector.

To represent a SIEM case in an external system, SIEM case fields are mapped as
follows:

* For {sn} incidents:
** `Title`: Mapped to the {sn} `Short description` field. When an update to a
SIEM case title is sent to {sn}, the existing {sn} `Short description` field is
overwritten.
** `Description`: Mapped to the {sn} `Description` field. When an update to a
SIEM case description is sent to {sn}, the existing {sn} `Description` field is
overwritten.
** `Comments`: Mapped to the {sn} `Comments` field. When a comment is updated
in a SIEM case, a new comment is added to the {sn} incident.
* For Jira issues:
** `Title`: Mapped to the Jira `Summary` field. When an update to a
SIEM case title is sent to Jira, the existing Jira `Summary` field is
overwritten.
** `Description`: Mapped to the Jira `Description` field. When an update to a
SIEM case description is sent to Jira, the existing Jira `Description` field is
overwritten.
** `Comments`: Mapped to the Jira `Comments` field. When a comment is updated
in a SIEM case, a new comment is added to the Jira incident.

=== Close sent cases automatically

To close cases when they are sent to an external system, select
_Automatically close SIEM cases when pushing new incident to external system_.

[float]
=== Change and update connectors

You can create additional connectors, update existing connectors, and change
the connector used to send cases to {sn}.

TIP: You can also configure which connector is used for each case individually
(see <<cases-ui-open>>). 

. To change the default connector used to send cases to external systems: 
.. Go to *SIEM* -> *Cases* -> *Edit external connection*.
.. Select the required connector from the `Incident management system` list.
. To update an existing connector:
.. Click `Update <connector name>`.
.. Update the connector fields as required.
