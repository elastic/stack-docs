== Overview

The products in the https://www.elastic.co/products[{stack}]
are designed to be used together and releases are synchronized
to simplify the installation and upgrade process. The full stack
consists of:

* {beats-ref}/index.html[Beats {branch}]
* {ref}/index.html[Elasticsearch {branch}]
* {hadoop-ref}/index.html[Elasticsearch Hadoop {branch}]
* {kibana-ref}/index.html[Kibana {branch}]
* {logstash-ref}/index.html[Logstash {branch}]

This guide provides information about installing and upgrading
when you are using more than one {stack} product. It specifies
the recommended order of installation and the steps you need to take
to prepare for a stack upgrade.

For detailed information about breaking changes in {version} and install
and upgrade instructions for specific components, see the individual
product reference guides.
