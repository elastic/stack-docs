beta::[]

{classification-cap} is a {ml} process that enables you to predict the class or
category of a data point in your data set. Typical examples of {classification}
problems are predicting loan risk, classifying music, or detecting the potential 
for cancer in a DNA sequence. In the first case, for example, the data set might 
contain the investment history, employment status, debit status, and other 
financial details for loan applicants. Based on this data, you could use 
{classanalysis} to create a model that predicts whether it is safe or risky to 
lend money to applicants. In the second case, the data contains song details 
that enable you to classify music into genres like hip-hop, country, or 
classical, for example. {classification-cap} is for predicting discrete, 
categorical values, whereas <<dfa-regression,{reganalysis}>> predicts 
continuous, numerical values.

When you create a {classification} job, you must specify which field contains 
the classes that you want to predict. This field is known as the _{depvar}_. It
must contain no more than 30 classes. By default, all other
{ref}/put-dfanalytics.html#dfa-supported-fields[supported fields] are included
in the analysis and are known as _{feature-vars}_. The runtime and resources
used by the job increase with the number of feature variables. Therefore, you
can optionally include or exclude fields from the analysis. For more information
about field selection, see the
{ref}/explain-dfanalytics.html[explain data frame analytics API].


[[dfa-classification-supervised]]
== Training the {classification} model

{classification-cap} – just like {regression} – is a supervised {ml} process.
When you create the {dfanalytics-job}, you must provide a data set that contains
the _ground truth_. That is to say, your data set must contain the {depvar} 
and the {feature-vars} fields that are related to it. You can divide the data
set into training and testing data by specifying a `training_percent`. By
default when you use the
{ref}/put-dfanalytics.html[create {dfanalytics-jobs} API], 100% of the 
<<dfa-classification-field-type-docs-limitations,eligible documents>> in the 
data set are used for training. If you divide your data set, the job stratifies 
the data to ensure that both the training and testing data sets contains classes 
in proportions that are representative of the class proportions in the full data 
set.

When you are collecting a data set to train your model, ensure that it
captures information for all of the classes. If some classes are poorly
represented in the training data set (that is, you have very few data points per 
class), the model might be unaware of them. In general, complex decision 
boundaries between classes are harder to learn and require more data points per 
class in the training data.

////
It means that you need to supply a labeled training data set that has a {depvar} 
and some fields that are related to it. The {classification} algorithm learns 
the relationships between these fields and the {depvar}. Once you’ve trained the 
model on your training data set, you can reuse the knowledge that the model has 
learned about the relationships between the data points to classify new data.

The effects of imbalanced data are automatically mitigated before the 
training. Nonetheless, it is a good idea to train your model with a data set 
that is approximately balanced. That is to say, ideally your data set should 
have a similar number of data points for each class.

[[dfa-classification-algorithm]]
=== {classification-cap} algorithms

//tag::classification-algorithms[]
{classanalysis-cap} uses an ensemble algorithm that is a type of boosting called 
boosted tree regression model which combines multiple weak models into a 
composite one. It uses decision trees to learn to predict the probability that a 
data point belongs to a certain class. A sequence of decision trees are trained 
and every decision tree learns from the mistakes of the previous one. Every tree 
is an iteration of the last one, hence it improves the decision made by the 
previous tree.
//end::classification-algorithms[]


[[dfa-classification-deploy]]
=== Deploying the model

The model that you created is stored as {es} documents in internal indices. In 
other words, the characteristics of your trained model are saved and ready to be 
deployed and used as functions. The <<ml-inference,{infer}>> feature enables you 
to use your model in a preprocessor of an ingest pipeline or in a pipeline 
aggregation of a search query to make predictions about your data.


[[dfa-classification-performance]]
== {classification-cap} performance

As a rule of thumb, a {classanalysis} with many classes takes more time to run 
than a binary {classification} process when there are only two classes. The 
relationship between the number of classes and the runtime is roughly linear.

The runtime also scales approximately linearly with the number of involved 
documents below 200,000 data points. Therefore, if you double the number of 
documents, then the runtime of the analysis doubles respectively.

To improve the performance of your {classanalysis}, consider using a smaller 
`training_percent` value when you create the job. That is to say, use a smaller 
percentage of your documents to train the model more quickly. It is a good 
strategy to make progress iteratively: use a smaller training percentage first, 
run the analysis, and evaluate the performance. Then, based on the results, 
decide if it is necessary to increase the `training_percent` value. If possible, 
prepare your input data such that it has less classes. You can also remove the 
fields that are not relevant from the analysis by specifying `excludes` patterns 
in the `analyzed_fields` object when configuring the {dfanalytics-job}.  
 
[[dfa-classification-interpret]]
== Interpreting {classification} results

The following sections help you understand and interpret the results of a 
{classanalysis}. To see example results, refer to
<<flightdata-classification-results>>.

[[dfa-classification-class-probability]]
=== `class_probability`

The `class_probability` is a value between 0 and 1, which indicates how likely
it is that a given data point belongs to a certain class. The higher the number,
the higher the probability that the data point belongs to the named class. This
information is stored in the `top_classes` array for each document in your
destination index.

[[dfa-classification-class-score]]
=== `class_score`

The `class_score` is a function of the `class_probability` and has a value that
is greater than or equal to zero. It takes into consideration your objective (as
defined in the `class_assignment_objective` job configuration option):
_accuracy_ or _recall_.

If your objective is to maximize accuracy, the scores are weighted to maximize
the proportion of correct predictions in the training data set. For example, in
the context of a binary <<ml-dfanalytics-confusion-matrix,confusion matrix>>
with classes `false` and `true`, the predictions of interest are the cells where
the actual and predicted labels are both `true` (also known as a true positive
(TP)) or both `false` (also known as a true negative (TN)):

TIP: If there is an imbalanced distribution of classes in your training data set,
focusing on accuracy can decrease your model's sensitivity to incorrect
predictions in the classes that are under-represented in your data.

By default, {classanalysis} jobs accept a slight degradation of the overall
accuracy in return for greater sensitivity to classes that are predicted
incorrectly. That is to say, their objective is to maximize the minimum recall.
For example, in the context of a multi-class confusion matrix, the predictions
of interest are in each row:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/confusion-matrix-multiclass-recall.jpg["A confusion matrix with a row highlighted"]

For each class, the recall is calculated as the number of correct predictions
(where the actual label matches the predicted label) divided by the sum of all
the other predicted labels in that row. This value is represented as a
percentage in each cell of the confusion matrix. The class scores are then
weighted to favor predictions that result in the highest recall values across
the training data. This objective typically performs better than accuracy when
you have highly imbalanced data.

[[dfa-classification-feature-importance]]
=== {feat-imp-cap}

{feat-imp-cap} provides further information about the results of an analysis and 
helps to interpret the results in a more subtle way. If you want to learn more 
about {feat-imp}, <<ml-feature-importance,click here>>. 

[[dfa-classification-evaluation]]
== Measuring model performance

You can measure how well the model has performed on your data set by using the 
`classification` evaluation type of the 
{ref}/evaluate-dfanalytics.html[evaluate {dfanalytics} API]. The metric that the 
evaluation provides you is a confusion matrix. The more classes you have, the 
more complex the confusion matrix is. The matrix tells you how many data points 
that belong to a given class were classified correctly and incorrectly.

If you split your data set into training and testing data, you can determine how
well your model performs on data it has never seen before and compare the
prediction to the actual value.

For more information, see <<ml-dfanalytics-evaluate>>.

////
Another crucial measurement is how well your model performs on unseen data
points. To assess how well the trained model will perform on data it has never
seen before, you must set aside a proportion of the training data set for 
testing. This split of the data set is the _testing data set_. Once the model has 
been trained, you can let the model predict the value of the data points it has 
never seen before and compare the prediction to the actual value by using the 
evaluate {dfanalytics} API.
