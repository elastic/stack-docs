[[tuning-detection-signals]]
== Tuning detection rules

In the {siem-app}, detection rules can be tuned to produce the best possible 
set of actionable signals. To reduce the noise level, you can:

* Disable detection rules when they match expected behavior, workflows, and 
allowed policies, and when they rarely produce actionable signals.
* <<manage-rules-ui, Clone and modify>> detection rule queries so they ignore 
authorized policies and workflows, thereby reducing the noise level while still 
retaining actionable signals.
* Clone and modify detection rule risk scores, and use branching logic to map 
higher risk scores to higher priority workflows.

For details about tuning rules for specific categories, see:

* <<tune-authorized-processes>>
* <<tune-windows-rules>>
* <<tune-network-rules>>

IMPORTANT: Due to the different way {beats} record network traffic direction, 
network detection rules may currently produce false-positive
signals. <<fix-network-rules>> explains how to resolve this issue. For more 
background information, see the
{ecs-ref}/ecs-network.html[ECS network.direction field].

[[filter-rule-process]]
=== Filter out uncommon application signals

Organizations frequently use uncommon and in-house applications. Often, these 
can trigger unwanted signals. To stop a rule matching on an application, you 
need to modify the rule's logic so it ignores the application's name.

For example, to prevent the <<unusual-process-execution-temp>> rule from
producing signals for an in-house application named `myautomatedbuild`:

. Go to *SIEM* -> *Detections* -> *Manage signal detection rules*.
. Search for the `Unusual Process Execution - Temp` rule, and then:
.. Click the actions icon on the rule's row (three dots).
.. Select _Duplicate rule_
+
A duplicate rule is created, named `Unusual Process Execution - Temp [Duplicate]`.
. Search for the new rule, and then:
.. Click the actions icon on the rule's row (three dots).
.. Select _Edit rule settings_
+
TIP: At the top of the *All rules* table, click `Custom rules` to display only 
your rules.
+
The *Edit rule settings* page is displayed.

. Do *one* of these:
* In the _Custom query_ field, add this condition:
+
`and not process.name: "myautomatedbuild"`
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/edit-dect-rule-query.png[]
* Click _Add filter_, and then define a `process.name is not myautomatedbuild` 
condition.
+

. Save the new rule and disable the original rule. If you want, you can delete 
the original rule.

[[tune-authorized-processes]]
=== Tune rules detecting authorized processes

Authorized security testing, system tools, management frameworks, and
administrative activity may trigger detection rules. These legitimate 
activities include:

* Ongoing and automated security testing and research.
* System and software management processes running scripts, including scripts 
that start child processes.
* Administrative and management frameworks that create users, schedule tasks, make `psexec` connections, and run WMI commands.
* Legitimate scripts using the `whoami` command.
* Applications that work with file shares, such as backup programs, and use the 
server message block (SMB) protocol.

To reduce signal noise for authorized activity, you can do any of the these:

* Add a statement or filter to the rules that exclude specific servers, such as 
the relevant host names, agent names, or other common identifier. 
For example, `and not host.name : "server-name"`.
* Add a statement or filter to the rules that <<filter-rule-process, exclude specific processes>>. For example, `and not process.name : "process-name"`.
* Add a statement or filter to the rules that exclude a common user. 
For example, `and not user.name : "security-tester"`.

Another useful technique is to assign lower risk scores to rules triggered by 
authorized activity. This enables detection while keeping the resulting signals 
out of high-priority workflows. Use these steps:

. Duplicate the same rule twice.
. In the first duplication of the rule, exclude the relevant user or process 
names (`and not user.name : "user-name"` or `and not process.name : "process-name"`).
. In the second duplication of the rule:
* Lower the `Risk score` (*Edit rule settings* -> *About* tab).
* Change the rule's query or filter so it only matches the user or process 
names excluded in the first duplication
(`and user.name : "user-name"` or `and process.name : "process-name"`).
. Disable the original rule.

[[tune-windows-rules]]
=== Tune Windows child process and PowerShell rules

Normal user activity may sometimes trigger one or more of these these rules:

* <<powershell-spawning-cmd>>
* <<suspicious-ms-office-child-process>>
* <<suspicious-ms-outlook-child-process>>
* <<suspicious-process-spawning-from-script-interpreter>>
* <<suspicious-process-spawning-from-script-interpreter>>
* <<system-shells-via-services>>
* <<unusual-parent-child-relationship>>
* <<windows-script-executing-powershell>>
 
While all rules can be adjusted as needed, use care when adding exceptions to 
these rules. Exceptions could result in an undetected client side execution, or 
a persistence or malware threat going unnoticed.

Examples of when these rules may create noise include:

* Receiving and opening email-attached Microsoft Office files, which 
include active content such as macros or scripts, from a trusted third-party 
source.
* Authorized technical support personnel who provide remote workers with
scripts to gather troubleshooting information.

In these cases, exceptions can be added to the rules using the relevant 
`process.name`, `user.name`, and `host.name` conditions. Additionally, 
you can create duplicate rules with lower risk scores.

[[tune-network-rules]]
=== Tune network rules

The definition of normal network behavior varies widely across different
organizations, each network conforming to different security policies, 
standards, and regulations. When normal network activity triggers signals, 
network rules can be disabled or modified. For example:

* To exclude outbound traffic from a specific host to a specific service, 
add a `not source.ip` statement with the relevant IP address, and a 
`destination.port` statement with the relevant port number
(`not source.ip : 196.1.0.12 and destination.port : 445`).
* To exclude an entire source subnet, add a `not source.ip` statement with 
the relevant CIDR notation (`not source.ip : 192.168.0.0/16`).
* To exclude a destination IP for a given destination port, add a
`not destination.ip` statement with the IP address, and a `destination.port` 
statement with the port number
(`not destination.ip : 38.160.150.31 and destination.port : 445`)
* To exclude a destination subnet for a given destination port, add a
`not destination.ip` statement with the CIDR notation, and a ‘destination.port’ 
statement with the port number
(`not destination.ip : 172.16.0.0/12 and destination.port : 445`).

==== False positives for common network traffic

These network rules may need tuning as they can produce false-positive signals 
for legitimate network activity:

[horizontal]
<<dns-activity-to-the-internet>>:: Personal devices, brought to work or used while working remotely, can query arbitrary DNS servers.
<<ftp-file-transfer-protocol-activity-to-the-internet>>:: FTP is sometimes used with external sources.
<<smtp-to-the-internet>>:: Marketing and business development workflows often 
use SMTP email traffic. Additionally, personal devices, brought to work or used 
while working remotely, may use consumer email services.
<<sql-traffic-to-the-internet>>:: Although uncommon, accessing databases over the internet may be part of development workflows.
<<tcp-port-8000-activity-to-the-internet>>:: Frequently used port while 
developing and testing web services.

[float]
==== False positives for common cloud-based network traffic

In cloud-based organizations, such as Elastic, remote workers access services 
over the internet. The security policies of home networks probably differ from 
the security policies of managed corporate networks, and these rules might need 
tuning to reduce signals for legitimate administrative activities: 

* <<rdp-remote-desktop-protocol-from-the-internet>>
* <<ssh-secure-shell-from-the-internet>>
* <<ssh-secure-shell-to-the-internet>>

TIP: If your organization is widely distributed and the workforce travels a 
lot, use the `windows_anomalous_user_name_ecs`, 
`linux_anomalous_user_name_ecs`, and `suspicious_login_activity_ecs`
<<machine-learning, {ml}>> jobs to detect suspicious authentication activity.

[[fix-network-rules]]
=== Reduce false positives for network rules

To reduce false-positive signals for network rules, duplicate the network rules 
and *either*:

* Remove all rule index patterns, except for the `filebeat-*` index pattern.
* Remove the `network.direction: outbound` statement from the query. The rule
then relies on CIDR notation to match traffic direction. The CIDR matches 
(`source.ip` and `destination.ip`) can be changed to match your network's 
configuration.

The following rules should be modified:

* <<dns-activity-to-the-internet>>
* <<ftp-file-transfer-protocol-activity-to-the-internet>>
* <<ipsec-nat-traversal-port-activity>>
* <<irc-internet-relay-chat-protocol-activity-to-the-internet>>
* <<pptp-point-to-point-tunneling-protocol-activity>>
* <<proxy-port-activity-to-the-internet>>
* <<rdp-remote-desktop-protocol-from-the-internet>>
* <<rdp-remote-desktop-protocol-to-the-internet>>
* <<rpc-remote-procedure-call-from-the-internet>>
* <<rpc-remote-procedure-call-to-the-internet>>
* <<smb-windows-file-sharing-activity-to-the-internet>>
* <<smtp-on-port-26-tcp>>
* <<smtp-to-the-internet>>
* <<sql-traffic-to-the-internet>>
* <<ssh-secure-shell-from-the-internet>>
* <<ssh-secure-shell-to-the-internet>>
* <<tcp-port-8000-activity-to-the-internet>>
* <<telnet-port-activity>>
* <<tor-activity-to-the-internet>>
* <<vnc-virtual-network-computing-from-the-internet>>
* <<vnc-virtual-network-computing-to-the-internet>>
