[[requirements-overview]]
== Requirements overview

To use the {stack} {ml-features}, you must have:

- the {subscriptions}[appropriate subscription] level or the free trial 
  period activated
- `xpack.ml.enabled` set to its default value of `true` on every node in the 
  cluster (refer to {ref}/ml-settings.html[{ml-cap} settings in {es}])
- `ml` value defined in the list of `node.roles` on the 
  {ref}/modules-node.html#ml-node[{ml} nodes]
- {ml} features visible in the {kib} space
- security privileges assigned to the user that:
  * grant use of {ml-features}, and
  * grant access to source and destination indices.

TIP: The fastest way to get started with {ml-features} is to
{ess-trial}[start a free 14-day trial of {ess}] in the cloud.

[[setup-privileges]]
== Security privileges

Assigning security privileges affects how users access {ml-features}. Consider 
the two main categories:

* *<<es-security-privileges>>*: uses an {es} client, cURL, or {kib} Dev Tools to 
  access {ml-features} via {es} APIs. It requires {es} security privileges.
* *<<kib-security-privileges>>*: uses the {ml-features} in {kib} and does not 
use Dev Tools. It requires either {kib} feature privileges or {es} security 
privileges and is granted the most permissive combination of both. {kib} feature 
privileges are recommended if you control job level visibility via **Spaces**. 
{ml-cap} features must be visible in the relevant space. Refer to 
<<kib-visibility-spaces>> for configuration information.

You can configure these privileges

- under **Security**. To open Security, find **{stack-manage-app}** in the main menu or
use the {kibana-ref}/kibana-concepts-analysts.html#_finding_your_apps_and_objects[global search bar].
- via the respective {es} security APIs.

[[es-security-privileges]]
=== {es} API user

If you use {ml} APIs, you must have the following cluster and index privileges:

For full access:

* `machine_learning_admin` built-in role or the equivalent cluster 
privileges 
* `read` and `view_index_metadata` on source indices
* `read`, `manage`, and `index` on destination indices (for 
  {dfanalytics-jobs} only)

For read-only access:

* `machine_learning_user` built-in role or the equivalent cluster privileges
* `read` index privileges on source indices
* `read` index privileges on destination indices (for {dfanalytics-jobs}
  only)

IMPORTANT: The `machine_learning_admin` and `machine_learning_user` built-in
roles give access to the results of _all_ {anomaly-jobs}, irrespective of
whether the user has access to the source indices. You must carefully consider
who is given these roles, as {anomaly-job} results may propagate field values
that contain sensitive information from the source indices to the results.

[[kib-security]]
=== {kib} security

IMPORTANT: Granting `All` or `Read` {kib} feature privilege for {ml-app} will
also grant the role the equivalent feature privileges to certain types of {kib}
saved objects, namely index patterns, dashboards, saved searches, and
visualizations as well as {ml} job, trained model and module saved objects.

[[kib-visibility-spaces]]
==== Feature visibility in Spaces

In {kib}, the {ml-features} must be visible in your
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-feature-visibility[space]. To 
manage which features are visible in your space, go to **{stack-manage-app}** > 
**{kib}** > **Spaces** or use the {kibana-ref}/kibana-concepts-analysts.html#_finding_your_apps_and_objects[global search bar]
to locate **Spaces** directly.

image::spaces.jpg["Manage spaces in {kib}"]

In addition to index privileges, source {data-sources} must also exist in the 
same space as your {ml} jobs. You can configure these under **{data-sources-caps}**. To open **{data-sources-caps}**,
find **{stack-manage-app}** > **{kib}** in the main menu, or use the {kibana-ref}/kibana-concepts-analysts.html#_finding_your_apps_and_objects[global search bar].


Each {ml} job and trained model can be assigned to all, one, or multiple spaces.
This can be configured in **Machine Learning**. To open **Machine Learning**, find **{stack-manage-app} > Alerts and Insights**,
or use the {kibana-ref}/kibana-concepts-analysts.html#_finding_your_apps_and_objects[global search bar].
You can edit the spaces that a job or model is assigned to by clicking the
icons in the **Spaces** column.

[[kib-security-privileges]]
==== {kib} user

Within a {kib} space, for full access to the {ml-features}, you must have:

* `Machine Learning: All` {kib} privileges
* `Data Views Management: All` {kib} feature privileges
* `read`, and `view_index_metadata` index privileges on your source indices
* {data-sources} for your source indices
* {data-sources}, `read`, `manage`, and `index` index privileges on 
  destination indices (for {dfanalytics-jobs} only)


Within a {kib} space, for read-only access to the {ml-features}, you must have:

* `Machine Learning: Read` {kib} privileges
* {data-sources} for your source indices
* `read` index privilege on your source indices
* {data-sources} and `read` index privileges on destination indices (for 
  {dfanalytics-jobs} only)

IMPORTANT: A user who has full or read-only access to {ml-features} within
a given {kib} space can view the results of _all_ {anomaly-jobs} that are
visible in that space, even if they do not have access to the source indices
of those jobs. You must carefully consider who is given access to
{ml-features}, as {anomaly-job} results may propagate field values that contain sensitive information from the
source indices to the results.

NOTE: {data-sources-cap} can be automatically created when creating a 
{dfanalytics-job}.

For access to use {ml} APIs via _Dev Tools_ in {kib}, set the {es} security 
privileges and grant access to `machine_learning_admin` or 
`machine_learning_user` built-in roles.


[discrete]
[[upload-file-security-privileges]]
==== {data-viz} feature

Within a {kib} space, to upload and import files in the *{data-viz}*, you must 
have:

- `Machine Learning: Read` or `Discover: All` {kib} feature privileges
- `Data Views Management: All` {kib} feature privileges
- `ingest_admin` built-in role, or `manage_ingest_pipelines` cluster 
  privilege
- `create`, `create_index`, `manage` and `read` index privileges for
  destination indices

For more information, see {ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges] 
and {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[{kib} privileges].
