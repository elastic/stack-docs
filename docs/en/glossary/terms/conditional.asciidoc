[[glossary-conditional]] conditional::
A control flow that executes certain actions based on whether a statement
(also called a condition) is true or false. {ls} supports `if`,
`else if`, and `else` statements. You can use conditional statements to
apply filters and send events to a specific output based on conditions that
you specify.
