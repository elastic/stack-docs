These {anomaly-job} wizards appear in {kib} if you have data from APM Agents or
an APM Server stored in {es}. For more details, see the {dfeed} and job
definitions in the `apm_*` folders in
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/{branch}/x-pack/plugins/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules[GitHub].

// tag::apm-jobs[]
[[apm-nodejs-jobs]]
== NodeJS
// tag::apm-nodejs-jobs[]
Detect abnormal traces, anomalous spans, and identify periods of decreased
throughput.

abnormal_span_durations_nodejs::

* For data from {apm-node-agents} (where `agent.name` is `nodejs`).
* Models the duration of spans (`partition_field_name` is `span.type`).
* Detects for spans that are taking longer than usual to process (using the 
  <<ml-metric-mean,`high_mean` function>>).

abnormal_trace_durations_nodejs::

* For data from {apm-node-agents} (where `agent.name` is `nodejs`).
* Models the duration of trace transactions.
* Detects trace transactions that are processing slower than usual (using the 
  <<ml-metric-mean,`high_mean` function>>).

decreased_throughput_nodejs::

* For data from {apm-node-agents} (where `agent.name` is `nodejs`).
* Models the transaction rate of the application.
* Detects periods during which the application is processing fewer requests 
than normal (using the <<ml-count,`low_count` function>>).

// end::apm-nodejs-jobs[]


[[apm-rum-javascript-jobs]]
== RUM Javascript
// tag::apm-rum-javascript-jobs[]
Detect problematic spans and identify user agents that are potentially causing
issues.

abnormal_span_durations_jsbase::

* For data from {apm-rum-agents} (where `agent.name` is `js-base`).
* Models the duration of spans (`partition_field_name` is `span.type`).
* Detects for spans that are taking longer than usual to process (using the 
<<ml-metric-mean,`high_mean` function>>).
  
anomalous_error_rate_for_user_agents_jsbase::
This job can help detect browser compatibility issues.
+
* For data from {apm-rum-agents} (where `agent.name` is `js-base`).
* Models the error rate of user agents (`partition_field_name` is 
`user_agent.name`).
* Detects user agents that are encountering errors at an above normal rate 
(using the <<ml-nonzero-count,`high_non_zero_count` function>>).

decreased_throughput_jsbase::

* For data from {apm-rum-agents} or {apm-node-agents} (where `agent.name` is
`js-base`).
* Models the transaction rate of the application.
* Detects periods during which the application is processing fewer requests than
normal (using the <<ml-count,`low_count` function>>).

high_count_by_user_agent_jsbase::
This job is useful in identifying bots.
+
* For data from {apm-rum-agents} (where `agent.name` is `js-base`).
* Models the request rate of user agents (`partition_field_name` is 
`user_agent.name`).
* Detects user agents that are making requests at a suspiciously high rate 
(using the <<ml-nonzero-count,`high_non_zero_count` function>>).

[[apm-transaction-jobs]]
== Transactions
// tag::apm-transaction-jobs[]
Detect anomalies in transactions from your APM services.

high_mean_transaction_duration::

* For transaction data where `processor.event` is `transaction`.
* Models duration of transactions by transaction type for APM services.
* Detects anomalies in high mean of transaction duration (using the 
  <<ml-metric-mean,`high_mean` function>>).
