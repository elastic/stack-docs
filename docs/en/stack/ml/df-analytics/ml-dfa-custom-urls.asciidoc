= Adding custom URLs to {dfanalytics-jobs}

You can optionally attach one or more custom URLs to your {dfanalytics-jobs}. 
These links can direct you to dashboards, the *Discover* app, or 
external websites. For example, you can define a custom URL that provides a way
for users to drill down to the source data from a {regression} job. You can 
create a custom URL during job creation under **Additional settings** in the 
**Job details** step. Alternatively, you can edit or add new custom URLs in the 
job list by clicking **Edit** in the **Actions** menu.

When you create or edit an {dfanalytics-job} in {kib}, it simplifies the 
creation of the custom URLs for {kib} dashboards and the *Discover* app and it 
enables you to test your URLs. For example:

For each custom URL, you must supply a label. You can also optionally supply a 
time range. When you link to *Discover* or a {kib} dashboard, you'll have 
additional options for specifying the pertinent {data-source} or dashboard name 
and query entities.

== String substitution in custom URLs

You can use dollar sign ($) delimited tokens in a custom URL. These tokens are
substituted for the values of the corresponding fields in the result index. For 
example, a custom URL might resolve to 
`discover#/?_g=(time:(from:'$earliest$',mode:absolute,to:'$latest$'))&_a=(filters:!(),index:'4b899bcb-fb10-4094-ae70-207d43183ffc',query:(language:kuery,query:'Carrier:"$Carrier$"'))`. 
In this case, the pertinent value of the `Carrier` field is passed to the target 
page when you click the link.

TIP: When you create your custom URL in {kib}, the *Query entities* option is 
shown only when there are appropriate fields in the index.

The `$earliest$` and `$latest$` tokens pass the beginning and end of the time
span of the data to the target page. The tokens are substituted with date-time 
strings in ISO-8601 format. For example, the following API updates a job to add 
a custom URL that uses `$earliest$` and `$latest$` tokens:

[source,console]
----------------------------------
POST _ml/data_frame/analytics/flight-delay-regression/_update
{
  "_meta": {
    "custom_urls": [
      {
        "url_name": "flight-delay-regression-results",
        "url_value": "dashboards#/view/7adfa750-4c81-11e8-b3d7-01146121b73d?_g=(filters:!(),time:('$earliest$',mode:absolute,to:'$latest$'))&_a=(filters:!(),query:(language:kuery,query:''))",
        "time_range": "1h",
      }
    ]
  }
}
----------------------------------
//TEST[skip:setup:sample_job]

When you click this custom URL, it opens up the *Discover* page and displays 
source data for the period one hour before and after the date of the default 
global settings.

[TIP]
===============================
* The custom URL links use pop-ups. You must configure your web browser so that 
it does not block pop-up windows or create an exception for your {kib} URL.
* When creating a link to a {kib} dashboard, the URLs for dashboards can be very
long. Be careful of typos, end of line characters, and URL encoding. Also ensure
you use the appropriate index ID for the target {kib} {data-source}.
* The dates substituted for `$earliest$` and `$latest$` tokens are in
ISO-8601 format and the target system must understand this format.
* If the job performs an analysis against nested JSON fields, the tokens for
string substitution can refer to these fields using dot notation. For example,
`$cpu.total$`.
* {es} source data mappings might make it difficult for the query string to 
work. Test the custom URL before saving the job configuration to check that it 
works as expected, particularly when using string substitution.
