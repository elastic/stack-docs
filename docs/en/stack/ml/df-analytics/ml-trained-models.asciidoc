= Trained models

beta::[]

When you use a {dfanalytics-job} to perform {classification} or {reganalysis},
it creates a {ml} model that is trained and tested against a labelled data set.
When you are satisfied with your trained model, you can use it to make
predictions against new data. For example, you can use it in the processor of
an ingest pipeline or in a pipeline aggregation within a search query. For more
information about this process, see <<ml-supervised-workflow>> and
<<ml-inference>>.

You can also supply trained models that are not created by {dfanalytics-job} but
adhere to the appropriate https://github.com/elastic/ml-json-schemas[JSON schema].
If you want to use these trained models in the {stack}, you must store them in
{es} documents by using the {ref}/put-trained-models.html[create trained models API].

In {kib}, you can view and manage your trained models within
*{ml-app}* > *Data Frame Analytics*:

Alternatively, you can use APIs like
{ref}/get-trained-models.html[get trained models] and
{ref}/delete-trained-models.html[delete trained models].
