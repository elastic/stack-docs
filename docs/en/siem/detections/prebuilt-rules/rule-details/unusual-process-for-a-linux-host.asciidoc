=== Unusual Process For a Linux Host

Identifies rare processes that do not usually run on individual hosts, which can
indicate execution of unauthorized services, malware, or persistence mechanisms.
Processes are considered rare when they only run occasionally as compared with
other processes running on the host.

==== Potential false positives

A newly installed program or one that runs rarely as part of a monthly or
quarterly workflow could trigger this signal.

==== Investigation guide

Signals from this rule indicate the presence of a Linux process that is rare and unusual for the host it ran on. Here are some possible avenues of investigation:

* Consider the user as identified by the username field. Is this program part
of an expected workflow for the user who ran this program on this host?
* Examine the history of execution. If this process manifested only very
recently, it might be part of a new software package. If it has a consistent
schedule - for example if it runs monthly or quarterly - it might be part of a
monthly or quarterly business process.
* Examine the process arguments, title and working directory. These may
provide indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks
it is performing.
