[[glossary-ml-detector]] detector::
As part of the configuration information that is associated with {anomaly-jobs},
detectors define the type of analysis that needs to be done. They also specify
which fields to analyze. You can have more than one detector in a job, which is
more efficient than running multiple jobs against the same data.
