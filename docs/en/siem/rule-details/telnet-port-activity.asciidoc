=== Telnet Port Activity

Detects network events that may indicate the use of Telnet traffic.
Telnet is commonly used by system administrators to remotely control older or
embedded systems using the command line shell. It should almost never be
directly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by
threat actors as an initial access or back-door vector. As a plain-text
protocol, it may also expose usernames and passwords to anyone capable of
observing the traffic.

==== Potential false positives

IoT (Internet of Things) devices and networks may use telnet and can be excluded
if desired. Some business workflows may use Telnet for administration of
older devices. These often have a predictable behavior. Telnet activity
involving an unusual source or destination may be more suspicious. Telnet
activity involving a production server that has no known associated Telnet
workflow or business requirement is often suspicious.
