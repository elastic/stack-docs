[[glossary-drilldown]] drilldown::
A navigation path that retains context (time range and filters) from the source
to the destination, so you can view the data from a new perspective. A dashboard
that shows the overall status of multiple data centers might have a drilldown to
a dashboard for a single data center. See {kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[Drilldowns].
